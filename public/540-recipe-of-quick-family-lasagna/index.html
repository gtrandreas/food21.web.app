<p>Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a distinctive dish, family lasagna. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Family Lasagna is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It is simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. They are fine and they look fantastic. Family Lasagna is something that I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a delicious recipe guaranteed to bring all the family together, look no further than Gennaro's classic Italian lasagne. Family-friendly chicken lasagna is made with layers of lasagna pasta noodles, green tomatillo salsa and tomato salsa, cilantro, Mexican cheese, spinach, diced tomatoes. This lasagna is meat-free and loaded with veggies.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook family lasagna using 14 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-family-lasagna">The ingredients needed to make Family Lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 2 and 1/2 pounds Ground beef 80/20 blend</li>
<li>Get 1 medium size yellow onion chopped</li>
<li>Prepare 1 green bell pepper chopped</li>
<li>Prepare  Mushrooms chopped</li>
<li>Get 2 tbsp butter or margarine (your preference)</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp cooking oil (I use canola)</li>
<li>Take 32 oz Ricotta cheese (your choice of brand)</li>
<li>Get 1 box and 1/2 of San Giorgio Lasagna noodles</li>
<li>Make ready  Mozzarella (your choice of brand)</li>
<li>Prepare  Grated Parmesan cheese (I prefer using Kraft)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
<li>Take 1 tbsp onion powder</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>Take 13 oz jar of Ragu traditional spaghetti sauce</li>
</ol>
<p>Oz swoops in with his daughter Daphne to make some. Historically, surnames evolved as a way to sort people into groups - by occupation, place of origin, clan affiliation. Your family will love this lasagna casserole, full of great lasagna flavor with less work! This is an easy weeknight meal that's kid-friendly.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-family-lasagna">Instructions to make Family Lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees</li>
<li>Fill a large cooking pot with water and bring to boil. Once boiling add the noodles. Cook noodles until they are semi al dente. (noodles will cook thoroughly once you put the lasagna together and into the oven)  -  - Helpful tip - I found it to be helpful once noodles are done to drain them and keep them in cool water to prevent them from sticking as you are preparing the lasagna. This also stops the cooking process of the noodles.</li>
<li>In a saute pan add your butter or margarine and oil. Once hot add your chopped onions chopped green peppers and mushrooms and salty until onions are translucent. Remove from heat and set to the side</li>
<li>In a medium-sized skillet begin browning your ground beef. Add your seasonings salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.</li>
<li>Stare in your onions, mushrooms and peppers to the cooked ground beef.</li>
<li>In a large cooking pot at your spaghetti sauce, and your ground beef mixture. And your sugar and cook over medium-high heat for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Begin building your lasagna. -  - In a lasagna dish I start off with spreading a layer of ricotta cheese. Next a layer of noodles. Next a layer of sauce. Next I sprinkle my grated Parmesan cheese. Next I spread an even layer of mozzarella cheese. -  - I repeat this process for about a total of four layers or depending on how deep your lasagna dish.</li>
<li>Place lasagna dish in preheated heat 375 degrees oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the top layer of mozzarella cheese forms a speckled golden brown, bubbly and delicious looking crust.</li>
<li>Let cool for a few minutes and Bone Appetit!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Invite family and friends to the table for this family-style dish. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Rinse with cold water; drain and set aside. Whenever autumn arrives every year my father would make his mother's lasagna recipe. Our recipe is for a basic lasagna featuring tomato sauce, ground beef, pasta and cheese.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up for this exceptional food family lasagna recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I&rsquo;m confident that you can make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be more interesting food in home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page in your browser, and share it to your family, colleague and friends.
