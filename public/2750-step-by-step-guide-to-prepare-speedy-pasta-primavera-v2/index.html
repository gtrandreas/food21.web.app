<p>Hello everybody, hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a distinctive dish, pasta primavera v.2. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Pasta Primavera v.2 is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. Pasta Primavera v.2 is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>A hearty, veggie packed pasta dish that's perfect for serving year round! It has so much fresh flavor, it's a great way to use up those vegetables in the fridge, plus it's a bright and colorful dish so it helps get the kids to eat their vegetables. Creamy Pasta Primavera is full of delightful spring vegetables for a light and fresh pasta you can easily serve up for dinner with or without meat.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook pasta primavera v.2 using 16 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-pasta-primavera-v2">The ingredients needed to make Pasta Primavera v.2:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  2-3 Tblsp extra virgin LIGHT olive oil, see note</li>
<li>Make ready  summer squash - yellow</li>
<li>Take  Italian squash - green</li>
<li>Make ready  yellow or green pepper</li>
<li>Make ready  asparagus spears</li>
<li>Make ready  sun dried tomatoes</li>
<li>Prepare  each parsley, dill, chives</li>
<li>Get  red pepper flakes - or to your liking</li>
<li>Make ready  oregano</li>
<li>Prepare  white wine</li>
<li>Prepare  butter</li>
<li>Make ready  capers w/vinegar (non pareil type/small)</li>
<li>Get  fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>Prepare  pecorino/romano grated cheese</li>
<li>Make ready  Extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Make ready  penne pasta,  cooked al dente</li>
</ol>
<p>Pasta Primavera-this classic pasta dish is a wonderful mixture of colorful vegetables and a simple lemon Parmesan cream sauce. It was soon being served at restaurants all over and is. Toss the pasta with the vegetable mixtures in a large bowl to combine. Toss with the cherry tomatoes and enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-pasta-primavera-v2">Steps to make Pasta Primavera v.2:</h5>
<ol>
<li>While preparing vegetables set a pot of water to boil and cook mini penne about 6-7 minutes until al dente. By the time the pasta is cooked the vegetables will be ready. The dish cooks up fairly quickly.</li>
<li>Prep all vegetables.  Wash, dry and slice both squash in half then into 1/4&quot; slices. Wash dry asparagus spears - snap off ends then slice spears into 1&quot; pieces. Slice sun dried tomatoes into 1/4&quot; slices. There are two types of sun dried tomatoes-soft and hard. If you have hard dried tomatoes, reconstitute them by soaking them in hot water for about 15-20 minutes until they soften.  Slice pepper into 1&quot; slices then cut slices in half.</li>
<li>In a large saute pan over medium heat put in about 2-3 tablespoons (depending on the size of the pan) of extra virgin LIGHT olive oil, 1/2 of the butter and red pepper flakes. When oil is heated add peppers and tomatoes. Cook for 2 minutes. Add herbs stir and cook for a minute more.</li>
<li>Add squash and asparagus - stir to incorporate vegetables. Once veggies heat up add wine (in center of pan-don't stir) cook for about 1 minute. Add butter (allow it to melt) then add lemon juice, capers, and cover. Turn heat down to medium low and cook for about 2 minutes. Do not overcook squash. They shouldn't be soft. They should cook up al dente like pasta.</li>
<li>When pasta is cooked, drain, return to pot (not over heat), add a few drizzles of extra virgin olive oil and stir. Add enough oil to coat pasta not drown in oil. Add generous helping of cheese and stir.  Pour veggies over cooked pasta and add another generous sprinkling of cheese.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pasta, vegetables and a sprinkle of cheese makes this a kid-friendly classic that adults will love too! What better way to get your veggies in than with a savory Italian dish like Pasta Primavera. My version combines a little bit of heat from red pepper flakes with fresh vegetables. Why resurrect pasta primavera at all? Because despite all the jokes, it was - and is - a good dish.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap it up with this special food pasta primavera v.2 recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I am sure that you will make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
