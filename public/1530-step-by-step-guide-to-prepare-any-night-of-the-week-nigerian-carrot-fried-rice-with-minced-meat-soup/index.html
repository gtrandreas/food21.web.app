<p>Though I already have a recipe for Nigerian Fried When the shrimps are cooked, remove the shrimps and set aside‚Ä¶ Add the carrots, green peas and peppers into the wok, with the beef or. This rice is always present in most ceremonies in Nigeria, I learned to make fried rice several years ago from a very close relative. Separate the meat from the water and deep fry the meat in groundnut/vegetable oil, then divide the water into two, use half(add water). Nigerian Fried Rice puts a spicy, flavorful spin on the traditional fried rice and is appealing on its own or served with a variety of other African food. Swap it out for beef or chicken or just double the shrimp.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up with this special food nigerian carrot fried rice with minced meat soup recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am confident that you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page in your browser, and share it to your family, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading.
