It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful. Quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens is something that I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>I served the sauce over fettucine noodles and put the chicken on top of it. Garlic bread on the side completed a fantastic meal!! I made this after my husband requested chicken alfredo. (I cooked up some chicken breast and served it with this.) He liked the flavor although I thought it was a.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens using 10 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-quick-yam-noodles-with-34alfredo34-sauce-and-greens">The ingredients needed to make Quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  yam</li>
<li>Get  onion, finely choped</li>
<li>Prepare  mushrooms</li>
<li>Get  garlic, finely diced</li>
<li>Take  milk</li>

<p>I served it with noodles and topped with grilled chicken. A zucchini noodles recipe (zoodles recipe) with a rich, creamy Alfredo sauce that's also low carb, gluten-free &amp; light. The best zucchini Alfredo ever! &mdash;- Insanely delicious vegan garlic alfredo sauce over sweet potato noodles! The base is spiralized sweet potato noodles, which cook up quickly until tender and provide the perfect amount of sweetness to offset the garlicky, cheesy cashew alfredo sauce.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-quick-yam-noodles-with-34alfredo34-sauce-and-greens">Instructions to make Quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Peel the yam and cut thin noodle-like strings. If you can julian it - all the better, but you don't have to! This should take you about 15 minutes- I just do it in front of the tv.</li>
<li>Bake the noodles in a toster oven until a crispy with a tiny bit of oil - if you have virgin olive oil - awesome, if not - it's totally okay as well! The noodlrs are really thin, but there are a lot - so it might take a little while to cook. It took me about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Once you're done cooking the yams and have them on a plate next to you,  fry the  mushrooms, onion and garlic in a bit of butter (note: if you want the dish to taste a bit more garlicy - add the garlic later on). Don't over cook them- you just want to brase the musrooms a little and coat them with the butter. It shouldn't take longer than 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the milk, cream and sliced cheese (I used gauda) to the pan - the sauce will reduce really quickly - but it's totally okay! The key is to do it as quick as you can. In the picture above you can see I wasn't as quick - so it was more of a creamy melted cheese than a sauce, but it's totally great as well. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper - this sauce is supposed to be a poorman's alfredo sauce so it's not supposed to be overly salty.  Pore the sauce on the noodles and mix a little.</li>
<li>Time for plating! Add some greens (I just use pre-made salad mix I get in the supermarket - no need to try very hard) above the noodles - as you're the one eating the dish you should decide how much is enough for you.  Add some grated salty cheese - I use Iraqi cheese, but feta will work fine as well.</li>
<li>That's it! You're done. You can add some walnuts, pecans, dried cranberries, pomogranate seeds, bacon bits works amazingly well with this, schnitzel strips (take chicken breasts/ a pirce of beef, smash it until it's about 3 sentimeters thin, cut it to strips, dip in an egg and then in panko/regular bread crumbs abd a little salt, fry until golden) and regular chicken breasts can work as well. I'm supet lazy, so I just eat it with scrambled eggs. All in all it's a way to make your loved ones to eat more veggies - without them being veggies!</li>
</ol>
<p>Cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan add oil, diced green pepper and onion and a can of chicken drained, cook until green pepper and onion is tender. Add Alfredo sauce, water and ketchup; mix well. Put the chicken back in the sauce and stir to coat. Remove from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up with this exceptional food quick yam noodles with &quot;alfredo&quot; sauce and greens recipe. Thank you very much for your time.
