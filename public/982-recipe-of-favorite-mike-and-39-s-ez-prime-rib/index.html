<li>● Pull roast from oven and let it rest for 5 + covered for minutes before slicing. This will help its fluids to rise to the surface.  -  - ● Cut binding strings.  -  - ● Slice in between bones and serve as 1 lb slabs per guest. -  - ● Serve with piping hot Au Jus and chilled Horseradish Sauce.</li>
<li>Make your Au Jus but substitute the water called for with beef broth for a more pronounced beef flavor.</li>
<li>● Upon serving, I'll lay the 1 lb slab on a guests serving plate alone. Then, I'll ladle piping hot Au Jus around the meat. I'll then garnish individual slabs with fresh parsley.  -  - ● Any other sides - I'll serve in seperate bowls or on side plates. [i.e., stacked baked potatoes, fresh asparagus, creamed spinach with bread, garlic risotto, or, simple wedge salads] -  - ● You can also serve this as an impressive Surf &amp; Turf dish. Just add steamed seafood of your choosing to the side. I'll commonly add King Crab Legs, Jumbo Shrimp or, Jumbo Scallops.</li>
<li>● Steam de-thawed crab legs for 5 to 8 minutes in a slight amount of water, lemon juice, pepper corns, a bay leaf and crushed garlic cloves to taste.  -  - ● Serve legs with melted or clarified butter and lemon wedges.</li>
<li>● Another great side is baked potatoes. -  - ● See my recipe for Mike's Perfect Baked Potatoes.</li>
<li>Creamed Spinach. Another great side dish. Quite traditional!</li>
<li>Rare Prime Rib with a dark Au Jus and chilled Horseradish pictured below.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Any leftovers can easily make an incredible New Orleans Old Sober, aka, Yakamein Soup. Check that recipe out in my personal recipes under Mike's Old Sober Soup. It's absolutely one of my wife's, friends and neighbors favorite soups! -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340687-mikes-traditional-old-sober-soup">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340687-mikes-traditional-old-sober-soup</a></li>
