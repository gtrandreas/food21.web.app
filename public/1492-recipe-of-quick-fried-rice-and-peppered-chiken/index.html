<p>Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, fried rice and peppered chiken. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Fried rice and peppered chiken is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Fried rice and peppered chiken is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>The simplest Chinese fried rice turns out to be the most difficult one! Because there is no meat, chicken, shrimps, and spices to enhance the flavor. As for the pepper, use the ground white pepper, not black pepper.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have fried rice and peppered chiken using 12 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-fried-rice-and-peppered-chiken">The ingredients needed to make Fried rice and peppered chiken:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 2 cups Rice</li>
<li>Make ready  Grean beans</li>
<li>Get  carrots</li>
<li>Get  peas</li>
<li>Prepare  chicken</li>
<li>Get  pepper</li>
<li>Make ready  heedah curry/fried rice mix</li>
<li>Take  salt</li>
<li>Make ready  seasoning</li>
<li>Get  oil</li>
<li>Make ready  onions 2 bulb</li>
<li>Take  Thyme</li>
</ol>
<p>Give it a toss: Season with the soy sauce, black pepper and a little oyster sauce, if desired. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. With the addition of pineapple, the regular chicken fried rice becomes so much more interesting, and delicious, because of the sweet tang of the pineapple. What I love most about this chicken and pineapple fried rice is the slightly caramelized taste of the pineapple, after stir-frying in the wok.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-fried-rice-and-peppered-chiken">Instructions to make Fried rice and peppered chiken:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Boil water then pour hot water into rice and wash then drain in collander</li>
<li>Dice ur vegetables.</li>
<li>Get a pot cook the chicken and season after that keep the stock aside.</li>
<li>Get a new pot pour little oil and fry the rice and keep aside also. after that mix the vegetables together with the rice</li>
<li>In a pot add little oil and pepper fry a little add in the stock and add salt seasoning and fried rice mix little thyme then pour in the rice and allow to cook after some times reduce the heat and allow to steam.</li>
<li>Then for the peppered chicken fry the chicken then add some pepper inside a pot and diced onions add seasoning and salt and little heedah spice and little stock allow to come to boil add in the fried chicken and allow to steam and it is done</li>
</ol>
<p>This chicken fried rice doesn't need any accompaniment and tastes great on its own. Add the rest of the ginger garlic along with little oil. Fry until the bell peppers are almost cooked. It includes the chicken, veggies, fried rice, and bean sprouts. My husband and I put together a combination of recipes that we found on the interenet and created this one.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up with this exceptional food fried rice and peppered chiken recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I&rsquo;m confident that you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading.
