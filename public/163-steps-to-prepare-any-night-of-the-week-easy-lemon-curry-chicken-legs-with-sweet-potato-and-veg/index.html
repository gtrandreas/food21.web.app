<p>I use red potatoes instead of yams and I think its better that way. The sweet potatoes make the dish overall eat a little to sweet for me. We'll be deep frying the potatoes and the carrots, so that they form a skin on the outside and don't disintegrate into the curry during cooking over In Vietnamese culture, curry is made with variants of coconut milk, chicken and served with a baguette that marks the historical influence of French cuisine. Why this chicken massaman curry needs to be on your menu this week. Thai Massaman curries aren't traditionally quick and easy.</p>
