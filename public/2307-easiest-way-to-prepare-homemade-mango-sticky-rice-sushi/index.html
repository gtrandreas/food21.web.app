<p>Hello everybody, hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, mango sticky rice sushi. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>So several years went by, and I started experimenting with Sushi. And I had an idea on how to CHEAT making sticky rice with mango. You can refrigerate the rice for some time, but you may need to warm it slightly to get it to an appropriate consistancy to mold into sushi or ball shapes.</p>
<p>Mango sticky rice sushi is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. Mango sticky rice sushi is something which I have loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have mango sticky rice sushi using 8 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-mango-sticky-rice-sushi">The ingredients needed to make Mango sticky rice sushi:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  jasmine rice</li>
<li>Make ready  glutinous rice</li>
<li>Take  mango</li>
<li>Make ready  oreo cookies</li>
<li>Get  condensed milk</li>
<li>Make ready  dessicated coconut</li>
<li>Get  brown sugar</li>
<li>Get  cocoa powder</li>
</ol>
<p>If your mangoes are still tough, simply store them at room temperature to let them ripen further before cutting them. Thai sticky rice with mango hits all the sweet, silky, creamy spots you want in a satisfying dessert. It's a nice, simple way to get your sweet fix. Mango sticky rice (Thai: ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง, RTGS: khaoniao mamuang, pronounced [kʰâ(ː)w.nǐa̯w mā.mûa̯ŋ]; Malay: pulut mangga) is a traditional Thai dessert made with glutinous rice, fresh mango and coconut milk, and eaten with a spoon or sometimes the hands.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-mango-sticky-rice-sushi">Steps to make Mango sticky rice sushi:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Soak glutinous rice in cold water for a few hours</li>
<li>Cook both jasmine and glutinous rice (in a rice cooker or however you'd like)</li>
<li>Peel and cut mango into 1cm by 1cm strips. Also cut into thin slices for topping.</li>
<li>In a microwaveable bowl, combine brown sugar and coconut, microwave for 30s so the brown sugar is partially melted</li>
<li>In a food processor, pulverize oreos into a powder. Use a bag and fists if you must</li>
<li>When the rice is ready, mix in a few tablespoons a condensed milk until the desired texture is acheived. We don’t want a pudding texture, nor do we want individual grains.</li>
<li>When the rice is properly combined, lay out a piece of plastic wrap on your sushi mat. Spread out the rice into a square, keeping the thickness to 0.5-1cm.</li>
<li>Try to fill the square as much as possible, while allowing overflow space. Sprinkle the oreo crumbs on top until it’s evenly covered. Now take your mango strips and coconut mixture, and place in a line 2 inches near the edge of one side. The photo here replaces cranberry sauce but tbh coconut is better</li>
<li>Roll up one side while holding onto your fillings to avoid it from slipping. Tuck it around your filling, while pulling out the plastic wrap so it doesn’t get rolled in. Continue rolling, while evenly applying pressure to the roll. Once you get to the other side, give it a full roll to regain the circular shape.</li>
<li>Slice (dip knife in water in between), and top with mango slices and a sprinkling of cocoa powder.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Thai mango sticky rice, the sticky rice is steamed, mixed with thick coconut cream and sugar, paired with perfectly ripe yellow sweet mango, served with some extra coconut cream on the top to make it even better, and finally often some crispy yellow mung beans are sprinkled on the very top. Mango Sticky Rice is sweetened sticky rice with fresh mangoes. This dessert is very popular in Thailand and Southeast Asia. Mango sticky rice is made with coconut milk, sugar, salt and mango cubes. The combination of mango and sticky rice are so delicious!</p>
