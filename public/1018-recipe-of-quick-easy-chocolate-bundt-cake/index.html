<li>Let it cool in the pan on a wire rack for ten minutes or so, then invert it onto the rack and let it cool completely out of the pan.</li>
<li>For the icing, just whisk all the ingredients together. I applied it after the cake was already cool.</li>
<li>Serve as is or shmancy up as you see fit.</li>
