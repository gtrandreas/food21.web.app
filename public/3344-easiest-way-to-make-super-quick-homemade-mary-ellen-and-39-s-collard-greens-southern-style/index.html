<li>Holiday greens!!!!</li>
<li>If you have store bought collards wash and go to step#4&hellip;.</li>
<li>Clean the greens by removing any worm holes or brown spots. remove stem because they can be tough. wash the leaves in a sink full of water with 1/4 cup vinegar OR 1/8 cup of salt.</li>
<li>Lay approximately 5-6 leaves on top of each other and roll tight.. cut the roll every 1-2 inches. cut up all the greens. I'm paranoid so I wash them again in vinegar water twice. this assures that they are clean.</li>
<li>Clean cut up greens can be frozen in a Ziploc freezer bag for a time when they are not available.</li>

<li>I put my hamhocks in the pressure cooker for 45 minutes with enough water to cover the hamhock 1/2 way with onion, salt, pepper. if u don't use a pressure cooker then boil the hamhock in a covered pot for 1 1/2 hr with a splash of vinegar in a pot. the vinegar will help it tenderize.</li>
<li>Add about 1/8 cup of vinegar per pot of greens.</li>
<li>Add a dash of baking soda to cut gas and keep green&hellip;</li>
