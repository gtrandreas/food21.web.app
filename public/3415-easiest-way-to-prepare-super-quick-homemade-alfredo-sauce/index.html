<p>Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, alfredo sauce. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>This creamy alfredo sauce turns a busy weeknight dinner into something special. Serve it with fettuccine or pour it over chicken breasts or steamed vegetables. Learn how to make alfredo pasta sauce with Chef Mark from LearnToCook.com.</p>
<p>Alfredo Sauce is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful. Alfredo Sauce is something that I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook alfredo sauce using 19 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-alfredo-sauce">The ingredients needed to make Alfredo Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  stick- Butter</li>
<li>Make ready  Cups- Half and Half</li>
<li>Make ready  Cream Cheese-</li>
<li>Make ready  Grated Parmesan/Romano (I just dump some in for now and taste it after everything is heated then add more if needed)</li>
<li>Make ready  Salt</li>
<li>Make ready  Pepper</li>
<li>Make ready  Garlic Powder</li>
<li>Make ready  Italian Seasoning but a light dusting (be careful, this is a strong seasoning)</li>
<li>Prepare  Chicken</li>
<li>Take  Chicken Breasts</li>
<li>Get  Salt</li>
<li>Make ready  Pepper</li>
<li>Take  Garlic Powder</li>
<li>Make ready  Rice</li>
<li>Prepare  White Rice- # of cups you want (it’ll double in amount)</li>
<li>Take  Water- double the he amount of water to rice (ex: 1 cup rice / 2 cups water)</li>
<li>Take  Salt</li>
<li>Make ready  Pepper</li>
<li>Prepare  Butter</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll then add the cream before the garlic browns, since burnt garlic. My Alfredo sauce recipe is a rich and creamy white sauce made with garlic, butter, heavy cream, and parmesan. This savory cheesy sauce infuses garlic into the butter and can be used with all kinds of. This alfredo sauce reminds me so much of my favorite Italian meal from years ago.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-alfredo-sauce">Steps to make Alfredo Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350°, and prepare chicken breasts. Place them in a 13x9 glass baking dish all touching one another so they stay moist. Season the tops of the chicken. Once oven is preheated, bake for 30-40 minutes.</li>
<li>While chicken is cooking, prep rice (you can use pasta, but I wanted rice this time). Get a sauce pan with a lid that’ll fit the amount of rice you want to cook. (I use jasmine rice, and I also like to use a bigger sauce pan so it gives it room to cook and the watery bubbles won’t overflow).</li>
<li>Rinse rice a few times to wash off the starch. Add the amount of water you need depending on how many cups of rice you used (just double it). Place on stove with lid on, and turn burner on high until it starts to boil.</li>
<li>Once boiling, turn burner down to simmer and cook for 20 minutes. DO NOT LIFT LID UNTIL RICE IS DONE! (It won’t cook right if you do). When rice is done, add in butter and seasonings and stir well. Rice is finished!</li>
<li>For the alfredo sauce, I used a large nonstick skillet on medium heat. Add in your butter cut into chunks (so it’ll melt faster). Once the butter melts, add in half and half, cream cheese (cut into chunks) and add rest of ingredients. I use a silicone coated wire whisk so I don’t scratch my pan. But keep mixing, and once it comes to a low boil turn heat down to low. Keep mixing until done. Adjust seasonings depending on your taste.</li>
<li>All done! Now combine everything together on your plate and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
