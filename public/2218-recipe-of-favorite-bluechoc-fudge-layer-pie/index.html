<h5 id="instructions-to-make-bluechoc-fudge-layer-pie">Instructions to make Bluechoc fudge layer pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In advance: Soak the cashew nuts in water for at least an hour (several hours or even overnight is fine too). Drain them before use (you will use them in the top layer).</li>
<li>Base layer: Use a food processor to grind the almonds down to a meal. It's fine if this meal is a little rustic with tiny pieces, rather than finely ground.</li>
<li>Add the vanilla extract and maple syrup until everything comes together. This mixture should stick together nicely between your fingers when pressed.</li>
<li>Line a loaf tin with parchment paper and compact the mixture down very firmly to create a 'crust' base layer. Pop it in the fridge whilst you make the next layer.</li>
<li>Middle layer: Soften the creamed coconut block (unless it is soft already) by chopping it finely and then placing in a heatproof dish.

Mix in thoroughly.</li>
<li>Compact this down onto the base layer. Press down with the back of a spoon. If the mixture starts to coagulate then simply press down with the pads of your fingers instead (I always end up doing this with my fingers. The warmth of your hands seems to allow it to be pressed down without coagulating).</li>
<li>Pop it back in the fridge whilst you make the top layer.</li>
<li>Top layer: Finely chop the creamed coconut. Pop the chopped coconut, soaked cashew nuts, dates, vanilla and maple syrup into the food processor and blend thoroughly until there are no pieces and everything is evenly combined.</li>
<li>Add the frozen blueberries last of all. Blend in the processor and combine thoroughly.</li>
<li>Spread the top layer on evenly.</li>
<li>Pop it in the fridge for at least an hour, until to top layer firms up (alternative pop it in the freezer if you want it faster).</li>
<li>To serve: Slice and serve. This keeps well for a few days in the fridge or keeps for a couple of months in the freezer.</li>
