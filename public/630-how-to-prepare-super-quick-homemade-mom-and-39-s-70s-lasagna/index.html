<p>Hey everyone, hope you&rsquo;re having an amazing day today. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, mom's 70s lasagna. One of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Mum's Lasagna Always freshly baked with love daily♡ 🍴Homemade creamy. Mom's Lasagna recipe: My mother was never an extraordinary cook, but the one thing she made that always tasted amazing was this lasagna. I have never found another lasagna that is as good as hers.</p>
<p>Mom's 70s Lasagna is one of the most well liked of current trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. Mom's 70s Lasagna is something that I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have mom's 70s lasagna using 20 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-mom39s-70s-lasagna">The ingredients needed to make Mom's 70s Lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Seasoning</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp sugar</li>
<li>Take 2 tsp basil</li>
<li>Take 1/4 tsp oregano</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>Take  Ingredients</li>
<li>Take 2 small onions, diced</li>
<li>Take 1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>Prepare 1 lb ground beef</li>
<li>Take 1 12-ounce can of chopped tomatoes, drained</li>
<li>Take 1 8-ounce can of tomato sauce</li>
<li>Get 1 6-ounce can of tomato paste</li>
<li>Take 3/4 cup water</li>
<li>Get 1 lb cottage cheese</li>
<li>Take 1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 lb lasagna noodles</li>
<li>Take 1 lb mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
<li>Get 2 packages of provolone cheese, sliced</li>
</ol>
<p>This lasagna is optimized for two things: being both delicious and easy. I've been making lasagna for a long time, and there are quite a few variables to play with. Lasagna noodles need structure—they have a lot of ingredients layered between them!—so they can't be too mushy. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente; they're ready typically two minutes before the amount of time on the box.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-mom39s-70s-lasagna">Steps to make Mom's 70s Lasagna:</h5>

<li>Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, and the water. Continue to simmer another 30 minutes and the set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven for 350°F.</li>
<li>Grease a 9x13 baking dish with olive oil.  In the bottom of the dish, thinly spread some of the meat sauce and then a layer of noodle.</li>
<li>On the noodles, spread a thin layer of the cottage cheese and then a layer of provolone. Repeat the layers until the meat sauce is gone.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the top with mozzarella and parmesan and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes and serve.</li>
