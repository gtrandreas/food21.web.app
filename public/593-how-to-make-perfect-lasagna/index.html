<p>Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a special dish, lasagna. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>The ultimate comfort food lasagna, with layers of rich homemade meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce , noodles , cheese and fresh mozzarella. Recipes and tips for terrific lasagna. Get traditional Italian versions and vegetarian lasagna recipes.</p>
<p>Lasagna is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Lasagna is something which I have loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook lasagna using 22 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-lasagna">The ingredients needed to make Lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 lb sweet Italian sausage</li>
<li>Make ready 1 lb ground beef (angus)</li>
<li>Get 1 chopped onion</li>
<li>Prepare 6-8 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
<li>Make ready 28 oz can of crushed roma tomatoes</li>
<li>Get 12 oz tomato Roma paste</li>
<li>Take 13 oz tomato sauce (I used maggiano’s diavolo tomato sauce)</li>
<li>Get 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbs brown sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp fennel</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp salt (optional)</li>
<li>Get 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper</li>
<li>Take 4 tbs fresh chopped Italian parsley</li>
<li>Get 12 + lasagna noodles (I used no boil noodles)</li>
<li>Get 16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
<li>Make ready 1 egg</li>
<li>Get 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Get Dash nutmeg</li>
<li>Take  Mozzarella cheese (as much as desired)</li>
<li>Prepare  Fresh grated Parmesan-Romano cheese (as much as desired)</li>
</ol>
<p>Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &quot;almond cake&quot;). Classic Lasagna is great for feeding a crowd, and also freezes well for new mom meals and quick thaw dinners. I've been making lasagna for a long time, and there are quite a few variables to play with. Mexican lasagna makes great leftovers, too!</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-lasagna">Instructions to make Lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and broth. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for at least 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (I cooked mine 2-3 hrs and made the night before)</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. (if you use no boil noodles you can skip this step and just layer as is)</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a dash of nutmeg</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
<li>To assemble, spread some meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish (I used a disposable oversized lasagna pan). Arrange noodles over meat sauce (I think I only used 4 noodles per layer). Spread noodles w/ ricotta cheese mixture. Spoon meat sauce over ricotta mix, and top with mozz/parm/romano cheese. Repeat layers (I made 3 layers)</li>
<li>Cover with foil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. (I made mine the night before to allow flavors to meld and had to cook a bit longer since it was starting out cold). Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can even serve it with eggs for breakfast. This lasagna recipe is super simple to make, and so flavorful. It's perfect for potlucks and other The site may earn a commission on some products. It couldn't be easier to make. Pasta noodles piled high and layered full of three kinds of cheese to go along with the perfect blend of meaty and zesty, tomato pasta sauce all loaded with herbs.</p>
