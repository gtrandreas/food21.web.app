<h5 id="steps-to-make-brad39s-traditional-pork-tamales">Steps to make Brad's traditional pork tamales:</h5>
<ol>
<li>To prepare the pork, lay chunks of shoulder meat in a crock pot. Preferably deboned. After 1 layer sprinkle seasonings over meat. Don't skimp. Layer more meat in and repeat. Drizzle vinegar over and close. Cook on low 8 hrs, then switch to warm.</li>
<li>For the sauce, destem and seed chiles. Place in a LG sauce pot. Just cover chiles with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Spoon out a cup of the cooking liquid, place in a bowl with the dried shrimp. Let sit 15 minutes. Add spices and bouillon to chiles. Simmer another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>When chiles and shrimp are done, combine and let mixture cool. When able to handle, liquefy all ingredients in a blender. In batches, including all of the liquid. Let sit in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>The next day, shred pork with a fork. Add a little bit more of the pork seasoning and 2 to 3 cups of the sauce. Fry in a large pan long enough for the pork to soak up the sauce. You don't want a lot of liquid in it though. This is the filling.</li>
<li>Next make the dough. Mix all dry ingredients. Cut in lard. Then mix the hot water in a bit at a time. Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in warm water 15 minutes or so.</li>
<li>When husks are pliable, find a small husk. Rip it into strips. This is what you will tie with.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of dough in the husk. About 3 x 5 inches.</li>
<li>Add 1 to 1/2 tbs filling on top of dough. Roll corn husk up like a burrito. Tie in the center with a double knot. Repeat many more times.</li>
<li>I used an auto steamer. You can use a LG pot if you have a rack to keep the tamales out of the water while steaming. Either way, layer tamales in your preferred cooking method. Steam for 45-55 minutes. This batch made about 4 dozen. I place in freezer bags and freeze. Good quick snack.</li>
<li>Meanwhile heat butter in a frying pan. Add flour and mix well. Don't cook until browned. Just before it turns. Slowly add the rest of the Chile puree. Cook until sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
<li>When tamales are done, remove husk and plate. Serve with sauce over the top and shredded cheddar cheese. Serve immediately. Enjoy.</li>
