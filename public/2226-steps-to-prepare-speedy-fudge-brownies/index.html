<p>Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a special dish, fudge brownies. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Fudge Brownies is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. Fudge Brownies is something that I have loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-fudge-brownies">Steps to make Fudge Brownies:</h5>
<ol>
<li>First of all the secret to a good baked good is to ALWAYS use good quality products you can just use cheap and low quality products and expect your whatever youâ€™re baking to taste excellent, never, especially in this case that we will be dealing with chocolates. So the moment you used low quality ingredients your brownies wonâ€™t comes out good and yummy</li>
<li>Secondly, make sure to always measure your ingredients correctly so as to avoid disappointments and your ingredients should always be at room temperature. Always sift in your flour itâ€™s an important trick the process makes your flour airy not dense!</li>
<li>I always use Cadbury cocoa powder because the flavor is so rich, addition of espresso intensify the chocolate flavor ðŸ”¥. You can use dairy milk, Hersheyâ€™s lindor or other high quality chocolates.</li>
<li>Start by grating your chocolate ( I used dark chocolate$</li>
<li>In a bowl sift in your flour, espresso,baking powder,cocoa powder,and sugar</li>
<li>In a microwave safe bowl add your butter and sugar and microwave till the butter melts alternatively use a double boiler to melt the mixture make sure the bowl is not touching the water. Add the chocolate and mix</li>
<li>Whisk in the egg one at time</li>
<li>Add your dry ingredients and fold (do not best pls) else youâ€™ll end up with dense and carry brownies. Add your grated chocolate or chocolate chips and fold</li>
<li>Line your baking pan or dish with parchment paper and grease. Then pour your batter.</li>
<li>Bake in a preheated oven at 160 degrees for 30 mins. Make sure you whack the tray after 20 minutes ie Tap the pan like three times on the floor ti crack the top of the brownies this will make your brownies to be even and not puff up</li>
<li>Serve your brownies with dollop of whipped cream/ ice cream, fresh fruits and chocolates. But who couldnâ€™t resist a warm brownies when the chocolate is still soft and melty ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹</li>
