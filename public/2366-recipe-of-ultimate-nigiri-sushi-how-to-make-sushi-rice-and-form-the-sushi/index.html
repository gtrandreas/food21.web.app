<h5 id="steps-to-make-nigiri-sushi-how-to-make-sushi-rice-and-form-the-sushi">Steps to make Nigiri Sushi (How to Make Sushi Rice and Form the Sushi):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Combine the sushi vinegar ingredients and mix together well. Put into a pan and heat over low heat. When the sugar and salt have dissolved, it's done.</li>
<li>Use freshly cooked rice. If you use rice that's been kept warm for a while, it won't absorb the sushi vinegar and will become wet and soggy. Use a bit less water than usual when cooking the rice.</li>
<li>Transfer the freshly cooked rice to a pre-moistened wooden sushi tub, and pour on the sushi vinegar. Cut the vinegar into the rice with a rice paddle. Don't knead the rice.</li>
<li>Fan the rice to evaporate any excess moisture. This also adds shine to the rice grains,</li>
<li>When the rice has cooled down to the point where you can touch it with your hands, cover it with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, then with the lid.</li>
<li>Each piece of nigiri sushi weighs about 16-18 g. With 3 rice cooker cups worth of rice (before cooking) you can make 55 to 60 pieces. When slicing the fish, slice against the grain.</li>
<li>If you hold the knife vertically 2 mm before you slice though the fish, the cut side will have a nice and clean finish.</li>
<li>This is how it looks when you hold the knife blade vertically. The right side of the slice will be a bit thicker.</li>
<li>Moisten your hands with vinegar-water (50/50 rice vinegar and water mixed together). Hold a piece of topping (a fish slice here) in your right hand, and spread on a tiny bit of wasabi with your left index finger.</li>
<li>Make a small round ball of sushi rice and place it on the topping. Make a dent in the sushi rice with your left thumb. This makes a packed sushi rice that is soft and gently falls apart in your mouth.</li>
<li>Press the top and bottom of the shari with your right thumb and index finger.</li>
