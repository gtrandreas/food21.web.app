<li>With serated knife, pizza cutter or dental floss, cut rolls into 12 to 15 pieces.</li>
<li>Place rolls touching each other in oiled 9x13 baking dish.</li>
<li>If you want bigger rolls, cut wider slices and you can also roll out dough bigger to make more rolls before filling.</li>
<li>Cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rise in warm place until double in size.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350. Bake rolls 15 to 20 minutes or until set in center. Cover with foil if browing to fast after 15 minutes.</li>
<li>While rolls are baking, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, butter and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. If to thick, add little splash of milk to thin slightly.</li>
<li>Spread half of the icing over hot rolls as soon as they come out of oven. This melts into nooks and crannies and is delicious!</li>
<li>When slightly cooled but still warm, spread the rest of icing over warm rolls.</li>
<li>I hope you enjoy these as much as I do :)</li>
