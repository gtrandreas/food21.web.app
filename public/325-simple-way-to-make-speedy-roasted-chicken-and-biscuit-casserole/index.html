<p>Brush the biscuits with the melted margarine or butter and then sprinkle some of the seasoned breadcrumbs over each biscuit. This ultra-homey casserole gets the bulk of its substance from tender pieces of shredded chicken breast. Rather than peeling and chopping fresh veggies, your prep time returns far more value in mixing up the biscuit dough, shredding the chicken, and mincing those vibrant fresh herbs to finish. This Chicken and Biscuit Casserole is made from scratch with easy whole-grain buttermilk drop biscuits.</p>
