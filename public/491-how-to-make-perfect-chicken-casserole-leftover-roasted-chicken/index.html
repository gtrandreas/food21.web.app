Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I’m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, chicken casserole (leftover roasted chicken). It is one of my favorites. For mine, I’m gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.
Leftover chicken, rotisserie chicken, or store-bought chicken strips work very well in this dish. There are no set rules: add chopped jalapeños, make a cilantro-based dressing to add on top after baking, or pan fry some bacon and top the casserole with it for a little extra decadence.">
