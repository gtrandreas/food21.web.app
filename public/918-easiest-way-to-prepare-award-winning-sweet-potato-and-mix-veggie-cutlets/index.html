<li>Mix well and mould into cutlets of desired shape.</li>
<li>Refrigerate this mixture for about 15-20 minutes, which help the cutlets to firm up.</li>
<li>In the meantime, mix together the flour and water, ensuring that there are no lumps and spread some semolina in a flat dish.</li>
<li>Dip each of the cutlets in the flour slurry and coat well with the fine semolina.</li>
<li>Place the coated cutlets on a tray and refrigerate for about half an hour, so that the semolina sets well.</li>
<li>Heat a pan and add oil to it for shallow frying the cutlets.</li>
<li>When it heats up, keeping the flame high, release about 4 cutlets in the oil.</li>
<li>Fry on medium to high heat, till golden brown on both sides.</li>
<li>When done, drain onto an absorbent paper.</li>
<li>Serve these delicious cutlets with some sweet chilli sauce and some mint coriander chutney for parties or as a tea time snack!</li>
