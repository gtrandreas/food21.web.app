<ol>
<li>★Recipe video★ (my You Tube channel)→youtu.be/6rkKh3Fvt30</li>
<li>【For Chiffon Cake】Sift the cake flour twice. Put the egg yolk in a large bowl. Put the egg white in another large bowl. Let the egg white sit in a fridge. Preheat an oven to 210℃ / 410 F.</li>
<li>Add granulated sugar to the egg yolk. Mix it with a whisk until whitish and heavy. Pour the oil little by little in it while stirring. Make it smooth. (Emulsify it.)</li>
<li>Warm the milk with a microwave to body temperature. Pour it little by little in the egg yolk mixture while stirring.</li>
<li>Add cake flour and stir it until powderiness disappears. And then mix strongly and speedy 20-30 times until heavy a little.</li>
<li>Take the egg white out from the fridge. Beat it lightly until watery. Whip it with a hand mixer on high speed.</li>
<li>When it becomes white and fluffy, add granulated sugar in 2 parts. Whip it until the peak hangs down lightly. Whip slowly on low speed for a min to smooth it.</li>
<li>Add the meringue to egg yolk batter in 3-4 parts. Stir well until smooth at 1st addition.</li>
<li>From the next addition, mix the top lightly, and then scoop it up and let it slip through your whisk; repeat scooping. Mix well until combined and smooth. Use a spatula to scrape the batter on the inner side of the bowl, and fold it.</li>
<li>Pour it into a baking sheet, and flatten it. Bake it at 180℃ / 356 F for 18 mins. After baking, drop the tray to prevent shrinkage. Take the cake out from the sheet, and let it cool; set aside.</li>
<li>【For Cheese Cream】Put the cream cheese in a bowl. Mix it until smooth. Add granulated sugar. Mix well until the roughness of sugar disappears.</li>
<li>Add granulated sugar and lemon juice to the heavy cream. Whip it while cooling with ice water until soft peaks form, on low speed.</li>
<li>Add the whipped cream to the cream cheese in 3-4 times, and fold it until combined. Let it sit in a fridge.</li>
<li>【For Coffee Syrup】Add instant coffee to hot water, and stir well. Add granulated sugar, and stir to melt the sugar. Add rum and mix well.</li>
<li>【Let's finish up!】Brush both sides of the cake with the syrup, and use up the syrup.</li>
<li>Spread a plastic wrap over the cake and turn it over. Cut off the edge (end of rolling) at an angle.</li>
<li>Spread the cheese cream over the sponge.</li>
<li>Roll the cake. Roll it up tightly at the beginning. Lift the plastic wrap and push and roll.</li>
<li>Wrap it with parchment paper. And then seal it with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Let it sit in a fridge overnight to make the sponge moist. -  (It's OK 3 hours as well.)</li>
<li>Sprinkle cocoa powder. It's all done!</li>
