<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-corn-dog-no-corn">The ingredients needed to make Corn dog, no corn:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  hotdogs</li>
<li>Get  eggs</li>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-corn-dog-no-corn">Instructions to make Corn dog, no corn:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Chop hotdogs in half if they are large. Stick in wooden grill sticks, more than half way to hold well</li>
<li>Mix: eggs, milk, flour, spices, baking powder, to make a smooth but thick batter like pancake mix. Put it in a long cup so you can dip to coat the whole hotdog</li>
<li>Heat the oil on high or medium high heat. Try out a drop of the batter if it floats to the top and starts cracking then you're ready to fry</li>

<li>The coat is not supposed to drip on the oil because once you stick it in, the coating will be held together by the heat, leave each one or two for about 3-4 minutes or till it Browns, if you feel it's browning too fast at any point of frying them, lower the heat</li>
<li>If you put two together make sure they don't come close to each other. And if you keep it long enough the hotdogs cook well and expand it's alright.</li>
</ol>
<p>What brands of hot dogs are Keto friendly? Does Corn Have Any Nutritional Value for Dogs? It is not just a filler in dog foods, it also has nutritional benefits.
