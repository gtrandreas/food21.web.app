  <meta name="description" content="Spaghetti and Meatballs
Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, spaghetti and meatballs. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.
It is by far the best homemade sauce and meatballs we have ever had. Iâ€™ve also just fried the beef and added it to the sauce, then used it to make lasagna.">

<p>Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, spaghetti and meatballs. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>It is by far the best homemade sauce and meatballs we have ever had. I've also just fried the beef and added it to the sauce, then used it to make lasagna. Spaghetti and Meatballs&ndash;nearly everyone's favorite &quot;Italian&quot; dish&ndash;is truly international fare.</p>
<p>Spaghetti and Meatballs is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions daily. Spaghetti and Meatballs is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They are fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have spaghetti and meatballs using 16 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-spaghetti-and-meatballs">The ingredients needed to make Spaghetti and Meatballs:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 shallot</li>
<li>Make ready 6 cloves garlic</li>
<li>Get 500 g lean ground beef</li>
<li>Make ready 1 large egg</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp ground oregano</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp ground basil</li>
<li>Get 3 slices white or whole wheat bread</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>Take 1 medium onion, chopped</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
<li>Take 1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
<li>Make ready 1 large (28 oz) can whole tomatoes</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 1 lb dry spaghetti noodles</li>
<li>Make ready 1 large handful fresh basil, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Prepare 1 large handful fresh Italian parsley, roughly chopped</li>
</ol>
<p>To brown the meatballs, heat olive oil in a heavy pot or large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove and drain on a paper towel after each batch. In the same pot, add the onions and garlic and cook for a few minutes, or until translucent. In a large saucepan, cook onion in oil until tender.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-spaghetti-and-meatballs">Instructions to make Spaghetti and Meatballs:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Pulse the shallot and 3 cloves garlic in a food processor until they're finely minced. Add them to a large mixing bowl along with the beef, egg, ground oregano and ground basil.</li>
<li>Dip 2 slices of bread in cold water. Squeeze the water out and crumble the wet bread into the meat mixture. Rip the third slice of bread into small pieces and add it too. Add 1 tsp salt and several grinds of black pepper, then knead everything together until well-combined.</li>
<li>Put a large pan on medium-high heat. Use your hands to form balls from the meat mixture, about 1 1/2 inch in diameter. You should end up with about 12 meatballs. Add a splash of veg oil to the pan and brown the meatballs evenly. It should take around 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the meatballs and set them aside. Clean any burned bits and excess oil from the pan, then add a fresh splash of veg oil, the onions and pepper flakes. Fry until the onions soften, about 1or 2 minutes. Cut the remaining 3 cloves of garlic into thin slivers and add them to the pan. Continue frying another 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir the tomato paste into the pan. Let cook 2 to 3 minutes then add 1 cup water. Add the can of whole tomatoes, juice and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand as you drop them in. Stir in the sugar. Return the meatballs to the pan. Cover and turn the heat down to medium-low. Simmer for 5 minutes, remembering to gently turn the meatballs over every so often. Check the seasoning and add extra salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>While the sauce continues simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. When the noodles are almost cooked, add the basil and parsley to the sauce. Toss the noodles with the sauce and top with plenty of freshly grated parmesan cheese when serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, water, oregano, salt and pepper. Serve hot on cooked spaghetti and pass the grated Parmesan. I make Martha's spaghetti sauce recipe from her &quot;Comfort Food&quot; cookbook with San Marzanos from our summer garden. I keep it in the freezer and it was outstanding with the meatballs. Please don't wipe out the pan. the oil, in which the meatballs were cooked, is what flavors the tomatoes and makes the sauce!</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up for this exceptional food spaghetti and meatballs recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I am confident that you can make this at home. There is gonna be more interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your family, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
