<h5 id="instructions-to-make-south-african-fudge">Instructions to make south african fudge:</h5>
<ol>
<li>prepare a tin to set fudge in.  line  with non stick foil.  I used a small/medium sized rectangular  ceramic dish. It depends on how thick you v want b the fudge to be.  use ca smaller dish for thicker pieced</li>
<li>place the water and sugar in a pot and put on to Medium low heat until the sugar completely dissolves.</li>
<li>add the syrup and butter to the pot,  stirring all the time,  until the butter melts.</li>
<li>add the tin of condensed milk. turn heat up to medium high and bring to  the boil, stirring all the time</li>
<li>Once it starts to boil reduce the  temperature to med low, ensure that the mix is constantly simmering.  simmer until at soft ball stage ( approx 25 minutes on medium heat) stir constantly to avoid burning.</li>
<li>Once soft ball stage is reached,  remove from heat and add vanilla essence.  stir the mix vigorously for approx. 3-5 minutes, or until the mix starts to thicken. You will see that it starts to set to the sides of the pot.  Once beaten and thickened ( do not beat for too long or it will set in the pot) pour into prepared pan and allow to set.  ( 30 minutes)</li>
<li>note: it is easier to use a food thermometer to measure for soft ball stage.  But you will see after aprox 25 minutes of constant simmering at medium low/ medium heat,  the colour and consistency will have changed considerably.  This is when you know it is nearing soft ball stage.</li>
<li>cut into squares and enjoy! :)</li>
