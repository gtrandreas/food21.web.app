<li>Remove the brown ends from garlic. Then, smash your garlic with a large Chefs knife and fine chop it. Also, zest the peel of one large lemon and squeeze out and reserve all of its fresh juices. You'll need at least 3 tablespoons of lemon juice so make her a big one! Slice the other lemon. Reserve 2 slices of lemon for a plate garnish, if desired.</li>
<li>Add olive oil and smashed chopped garlic to a heated pan. Simmer for 1 1/2 minutes but, be very careful not to burn garlic. In fact, stir it constantly. It's only a minute and a half.</li>
<li>Immediately remove oil from heat. Add all other ingredients to your garlic infused olive, stir and then, allow mixture to come back to a quick simmer. Then, remove immediately again from heat.</li>
<li>Add mixture to an oven safe baking dish. No need to use a nonstick spray. Add chicken breasts and coat their tops with your mixture as well. Then, sprinkle your coated chicken tops with sea salt and lemon pepper to taste. Also, add your lemon wedges - reserving 2 wedges lemon for garnish if desired.</li>
<li>Wrap up oven safe dish tightly with tinfoil and bake at 400° to 425° for 45 minutes or longer, depending upon your chicken breasts size. After baking, pierce your largest, thickest piece with a knife. If she runs pink - bake 5 to 10 minutes longer. Then, check her again.</li>
<li>● Serve atop a rice type of your choosing. Or, a bed of baked asparagus. You can make your own homemade rice or, use a simple microwavable rice for extreme ease. Garnish plate with lemon wedges and fresh sprinkled parsley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ● Also, serve your dish with a bowl of your hot pan garlic and lemon juice to the side so your guests can add it as they choose to their chicken, rice or asparagus.</li>
<li>● To make your asparagus bed - rinse, pat dry cut the bottom 2&quot; from your spears. They're woody.                                                                                            ● Coat spats with olive oil or a spray olive oil.                                                                                    ● Sprinkle spears liberally with Lemon Pepper and mix.                                        ● To taste - sprinkle on lemon juice, garlic and onion powder.                                           ● Sprinkle spears with fresh grated Parmesean Cheese.                                               ● Bake asparagus in your 425° oven alongside your chicken for 20 minutes.                                                ● Place chicken atop asparagus bed and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
