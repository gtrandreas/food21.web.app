<li>Using table spoons full you will receive 3 x 3 cookies on the sheet. These need 15 minutes baking time</li>
<li>Now you can always alternate one sheet in the oven, one cooling down until all cookies are baked.</li>
<li>Bake each sheet for 13 min (can vary +/- 1-3 minutes depending on oven, dough temperature and altitude)</li>
<li>Let cool on parchment paper on cookie rack, as cookies will be soft if you try to take them off too soon</li>
<li>Keep on rack for more cooling, then reuse parchment paper for next batch</li>
<li>Pile up to eat or store in airtight container in cool place</li>
