Hey everyone, it is Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we’re going to prepare a special dish, almond coconut vanilla cake💝. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.
It’s almost like a pound cake meets vanilla sheet cake and all covered in a delicious coconut ganache. This cake is gluten-free and dairy-free, as I used gluten-free flours and my beloved Almond Breeze almondmilk.">
