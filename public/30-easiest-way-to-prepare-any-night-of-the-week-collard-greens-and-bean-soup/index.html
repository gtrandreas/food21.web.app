<h5 id="steps-to-make-collard-greens-and-bean-soup">Steps to make Collard Greens and Bean Soup:</h5>
<ol>
<li>You may chose to add more or less beans depending on how thick you like the soup as well with the greens. I prefer this soup with lots of greens and reasonably thick. You can add potatoes to make the soup thicker aswell but I chose not too.</li>
<li>Sort through the beans and discard any hardened kernels then wash in 3-4 changes of clean water. Next soak the beans in water 24 hours before cooking and ensure the beans have enough water to cover them fully.</li>
<li>Add 1.5 litres of fresh water to a pressure cooker. Discard the old water and add the beans.</li>
<li>Cook for approximately 30 minutes.</li>
<li>If you don't have a pressure cooker you can cook them using a saucepan. Add 1.5 litres of fresh water to the saucepan and bring to the boil for at least 20 minutes. Lower heat and Simmer for another 30-40 minutes or until beans are almost mushy ensuring saucepan does not run dry.</li>
<li>Set the cooker aside until needed when the beans are done.</li>
<li>To prepare your greens rinse well and cut off the storks.  Role 2-3 leaves as tightly as you can and slice as thinly as you can through the leaves.</li>
<li>Place the greens in a bowl, 5-10 minutes before cooking add lukewarm water to the greens.</li>
<li>In another saucepan bring water to the boil. Add the cabbage to the water once it has started to boil. Press down with a spoon to submerge as much of the greens as possible. Boil for 5-6 minutes pressing down with the spoon often.</li>
<li>While the cabbage is cooking blitz about 3/4 of the beans. Add the blitzed mixture back to the pan as well as the whole beans, along with the water the beans have cooked in.</li>
<li>Add the pan back to the hob on a medium to high heat.</li>
<li>Add the garlic, onion, stock cube, bay leaves and salt to the beans.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the water (500ml).</li>
<li>Drain the greens and add them to the soup.</li>
<li>Drizzle with the olive oil and stir.</li>
<li>Bring to the boil for a further 25-30 minutes. Stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>2-3 minutes before turning the heat off add in the chopped coriander. (You may chose to add more or less. I roughly added about 5 tablespoons, but its your choice.)</li>
<li>Remove the saucepan from the heat.</li>
<li>Check seasoning, more salt maybe needed.</li>
<li>Add another drizzle of olive oil, I added about another 3-4 tablespoons. And stir.</li>
<li>Let the soup rest for at least 10 minutes and serve.</li>
<li>I garnished with fresh parsley and olive oil when I plated the soup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great Northern beans, chopped yellow onion, white wine, garlic, and fresh thyme give this soup incredible flavor. For a weeknight supper, serve with slices of crusty bread spread with goat cheese. Add the collard greens and stir-fry until they start to wilt and soften. Mash some of the beans against the sides of the pan to thicken the soup slightly. Stir in the chopped parsley and remaining rosemary.</p>
