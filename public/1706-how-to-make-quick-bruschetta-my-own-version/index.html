<ol>
<li>For homemade white loaf: Take a bowl. Mix the dry ingredients really well. Then add the liquid ingredients properly. Hot water and hot milk will kill the yeast so make sure to add lukewarm milk and water to the dry mixture.</li>
<li>Knead this well together to a soft dough. Use 1 or 2 tbsp more lukewarm water if you need. The dough should be really soft.</li>
<li>Pour oil in your kitchen platform and knead your dough properly without using any more flour.</li>
<li>1st Proofing:- Grease a large bowl &amp; the tight dough with sufficient oil. Then cover the bowl with a plate and keep it in a dark cabinet for 1 hour.</li>
<li>After 1 hour, we will punch the risen dough(almost doubled) and knock out the air and knead it for 2 mins. After 2 mins, grease the dough, kitchen platform and the rolling pin properly and start rolling out to a large rectangle shape.</li>
<li>2nd Proofing:- Make sure to roll it perfectly neither too loose nor too tight.Once it is rolled properly just ensure to pinch the sides and seal properly. Place it in the loaf pan and grease the top of the dough with some oil. Cover the pan with a cling wrap and keep it in the dark cabinet for 30 mins.</li>

<li>After 30 mins, you will see the dough has risen so well. Then again apply some oil on the top of the loaf. Cover the loaf pan with the aluminum foil and keep it in the lower rack of the oven and bake it for 30 mins in a preheated oven at 350 F.</li>
<li>For Bruschetta:-1. Take a bowl. Add everything except bread slices and cheese. Mix properly and check the seasoning and then keep it aside.</li>

Keep the slices of the bread on the pan then add the above mixture and grated cheese from the top. Then cover the pan and cook it for 5-10mins in a low flame. After 10mins, you will see the cheese must have melted nicely.</li>
