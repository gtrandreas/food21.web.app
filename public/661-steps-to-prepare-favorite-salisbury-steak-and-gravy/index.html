<p>Salisbury steak is a classic American dish, similar to Hamburg steak and not too different from meatloaf and meatballs (except in shape). Seasoned with onion, garlic, and plenty of black pepper, formed into a steak-like patty, and pan-fried, it's served with a rich and meaty mushroom brown gravy. Salisbury steak also freezes well, so feel free to double the recipe and freeze half. Salisbury steak isn't a steak, it's basically fancy version of a bun-less hamburger that is simmered in gravy and traditionally served with mashed potatoes. I hated it as a kid, but now I can't get enough of it.</p>
