It is easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look fantastic. Butternut squash and curry soup with chicken is something that I have loved my whole life.</p>
<p>I have a delicious new butternut squash soup recipe to share with you guys today! Last night Ryan and I loosely followed Cook Smarts' recipe for butternut squash curry, but transformed it into more of a broth-based soup with chicken and kale. This smooth curried butternut squash is sweetened with a little honey and is certain to keep you warm in winter.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have butternut squash and curry soup with chicken using 14 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-butternut-squash-and-curry-soup-with-chicken">The ingredients needed to make Butternut squash and curry soup with chicken:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 butternut squash</li>
<li>Make ready 1 yellow onion</li>
<li>Get 1 clove garlic</li>
<li>Get 48 oz vegetable stock</li>
<li>Get 1 can coconut milk (plus more for garnish)</li>
<li>Take 1 tbs brown sugar</li>
<li>Get 2 tbs yellow curry paste (more or less depending on taste)</li>
<li>Prepare 2 chicken breast’s (optional)</li>
<li>Take 1 tbs cumin (for chicken)</li>
<li>Take 1 tbs turmeric (for chicken)</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbs onion powered (for chicken)</li>
<li>Take 1 1/2 tsp ground ginger (for chicken)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (for chicken)</li>
<li>Get  Olive oil (see directions)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a delicious Curried chicken and vegetable soup. Creamy Curried Butternut Squash Soup infused with coconut milk and yellow curry powder. A savory, simple soup that's perfect for the fall and I use Knorr chicken, beef and vegetable stock concentrate when making soup or gravy. It is very salty so take that tip into account when seasoning.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-butternut-squash-and-curry-soup-with-chicken">Instructions to make Butternut squash and curry soup with chicken:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Pre heat oven to 400° then roast the butternut squash. I usually cut it in half, poke holes in it then microwave each half for 4 minutes. I then remove the skin, dice it into chunks, and cover them in olive oil and a little salt and pepper. Then put it in the oven and cook for about 30 minutes or until the squash is soft</li>
<li>Dice the onion and put it in an oiled pan with the clove of garlic. Sauté on medium heat until onion is caramelized.</li>
<li>When the squash and onions are done, throw them into a stock pot and set them aside so you can prep your chicken.</li>
<li>Cover the chicken breasts in olive oil and add salt and pepper. Then cover them in the dry spices and roast them in a 350° oven for about 20 minutes or until there is no pink in the middle. When the chicken is done, shred it and set it to the side.</li>
<li>While the chicken is cooking, add the vegetable stock to the pot with your squash and onion and heat on medium low. You can also add your brown sugar and your curry paste. After the curry has been incorporated, you can use a hand blender to blend the chunks of squash and onions until the soup is smoothe.</li>
<li>Add your can of coconut milk (be sure to shake it before opening the can)</li>
<li>Ladle some of the warm soup into your bowl and add the chicken and some extra coconut milk if choose!</li>
</ol>
<p>Flavorful, protein-packed chicken soup made with butternut squash and green chile! This comforting dish comes together in one pot and is perfect for a cold night. Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board to shred with two forks. Add chicken back to pot, taste. With onion and lightly spiced with curry powder, ginger, mustard seeds, cumin.</p>
