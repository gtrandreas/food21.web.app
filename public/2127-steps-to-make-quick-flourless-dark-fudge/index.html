<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-flourless-dark-fudge">The ingredients needed to make Flourless Dark Fudge:</h5>
<ol>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-flourless-dark-fudge">Steps to make Flourless Dark Fudge:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Chop the butter into Tbs, approx, so it melts faster, put the pieces into a 1 qt sauce pan on med heat. Meanwhile, measure out the cocoa, crack your eggs and measure your dairy or milks. If you don't have whipping cream, use a half cup of whole milk.</li>
<li>When the butter is bubbling, use a 2&quot; whisk to mix the sugar into it and add the cocoa. Mix completely. It's going to be very grainy! Keep mixing.</li>
<li>At this point you can begin preheating your oven to 350°F (180°C). Now take the pot off the heat and begin adding the milk in a bit at a time. The mass of chocolate will separate but DON'T stop mixing! Keep adding the milk, approximately a Tbs at a time until it's ALL mixed in.

After another 25 minutes it was perfect so I'll say 50 minutes cooking time and a clean skewer or tooth pick or whatever you use to check your cakes should come out clean.</li>
