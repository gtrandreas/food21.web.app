recipeinstructions:
- "MAKING THE PASTRY Rub the cubed butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir through the sugar and beaten egg.

Wrap the dough in Clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least an hour to relax. Roll the relaxed dough on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of 1cm.

- "MAKING THE FILLING Peel and cut the apples into thick slices, chucking them into a bowl. Throw the sugar, cinnamon and raspberries in with the apple and toss together with a good squeeze of apple juice. Tip the apple mixture into the chilled tart shell."
- "THE TOPPING Brush the top of the sides of the tart shell. Roll another circle of dough that is slightly bigger than the tart case and drape it over the apples. Make a lattice if you prefer. Trim the lid to fit the tart, then pinch the lid into the brushed sides of the tart shell with fingers or a fork. Poke a few slits into the middle of the lid to allow steam to escape the pie. Brush the egg white over the pie lid then sprinkle with caster sugar."
