All Reviews for Fudge Brownies I. These chocolate brownies use both Dutch cocoa powder and dark chocolate, as well as brown butter, for a rich and complex flavor. Fudge brownies are dark, dense, fudge-like brownies. They contain more cocoa than cake-like brownies and as a result they are slightly more bitter and have more of a &#34;dark chocolate&#34; taste.
