recipeingredient:
- "2 lb chicken wings drums or flats"
- " EVOO"
- " Paprika"
- " Lemon Pepper"
- " Onion Powder"
- " Garlic Powder"
- " Cooking spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325°F.  For easy clean-up, line a cookie sheet with foil.  Use a slotted rack (I use a regular cooling rack) and cover with foil.  Punch a few holes in it to allow grease to drip onto the sheet pan.  Spray with cooking spray."
- "If wings are thawed, rinse and pat dry.  I usually put them in a zip lock bag - less dishes and clean up.  Pour some EVOO in the bag and add the wings.  Season to taste.  I use the above ingredients.  Use whatever suits you."
- "Bake at 325 for 1 hour.   Turn and bake another hour or until a meat thermometer reads 180.  If you like them a little more crispy, put them under the broiler for a few mins. - not long as they will dry out."
- "TIPS: If you are in a hurry, turn the heat up and cook them for less time. I was never a wings eater, until a friend told me about these. They are moist and fall off the bone. I like mine dry and dip in sauce when done. You can roast these, toss in your choice of sauce and stick back in the oven to heat. May take 2 hours, but well worth it."
