- "1 egg"
- "24 oz cottage cheese small curd rinsed an drained"
- "1/4 cup grated parmesean cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375°F."
- "Meat Sauce: Cook ground beef, chopped onion, and minced garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat. When beef is browned and onion is tender, drain. Wipe out saucepan with a paper towel. Return meat to saucepan. Add pasta sauce and basil. Stir over medium-low heat until well blended. Turn to low heat and let simmer."
- "Filling: Add egg to a medium bowl and whisk well. Add parmesean cheese, cottage cheese, and gently stir until well mixed."
- "Spread about 1 cup of meat sauce over the bottom of a 4 quart baking dish. Add a single layer of lasagna noodles. Spread about 1 cup of the filling over noodles. Sprinkle about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the filling. Note that you can use a little more or less than the 1 cup measurements here for the meat sauce and filling. I usually go a little sparingly on the first two layers so that the top layer will be the thickest."
- "Repeat previous step to make a second layer.  Repeat again to make a third and final layer, using all that remains of meat sauce, filling, and mozzarella."
- "Cover loosely with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Let stand for 5-10 minutes. Enjoy!"
