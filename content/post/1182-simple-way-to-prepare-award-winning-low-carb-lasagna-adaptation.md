- " Italian Spice Mix"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Peel and slice the Squash into thin, Lasagna like slices. The original recipe suggested using a Mandolin to keep the slices of uniform thickness, but I&#39;d recommend just slicing it as close to uniform as possible. Place the squash slices in an 8 oz square microwave safe glass baking dish, and microwave the squash slices for 4 minutes, covered with Saran Wrap. Remove the squash slices, and spray the glass dish with Cooking Spray."
- "Roughly dice the red onion, and saute it with the garlic for about 4 minutes. Clean the spinach leaves, and wilt them in the pan with the onions and garlic."
- "Get your blender out, and put yogurt, milk, and 1 Package of Kraft Creamy Melt cheese in the blender. Blend the mixture for 20 seconds. Add flour, salt, and eggs, then blend for another minute."
- "Pour 1/2 Cup of the yogurt/milk sauce into the square glass baking pan. Place a layer of the microwaved Butternut Squash atop the yogurt/milk sauce in the baking pan. Layer the onion/garlic/wilted spinach mixture, Gruyere Cheese, and the remaining package of Kraft Creamy Melt Italian cheese, for 2-3 layers if possible. Pour the remaining yogurt mixture over the top of the layers, top it with more Gruyere, and sprinkle Italian Spice Mix on top of the cheese."
- "Bake the mixture for 50 Minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and start the broiler. Broil the Lasagna for 4 more minutes to crisp the top. Let it rest for 15 minutes, and it should be ready to serve."
