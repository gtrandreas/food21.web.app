recipeinstructions:
- "Mash Potatoes:- Peel and clean the potatoes. Place in a pan and fill water to cover. Cook until soft and ready. Pour excess water. Add 1 cup milk, the butter or margarine and season with salt."
- "Mash until smooth and not too dry. The milk and butter is to attain a great taste and creamy texture."
- "Beef Stew:- Cut the meat into cubes or stripes. Cut the onions and garlic. Put 2 table spoons of oil in a pan, fry the onions and garlic until soft. Do not burn the garlic."
- "Add the meat, ensure the pan or sufuria is big, we do not want to clog rather have a good golden color on the meat, cook until you see some browning, add the tomatoes. They will clear all the browning and create a thick paste."
- "At this point you can add spices of choice and some water or stock if the stew is too thick. Cook for 1 min then remove from heat. Add corriander and cover."
- "Vegetables:- Cut cabbage, carrots and radish (I used white radish) into desired shapes and mix together. I went with long stripes. Heat butter in a pan on medium heat and add the vegetables. Toss and keep turning for 1-2minutes. I like to feel the crunchiness in veggies. Remove from heat and season with salt."
