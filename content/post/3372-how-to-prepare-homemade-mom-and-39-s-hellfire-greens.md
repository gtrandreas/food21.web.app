- " ground cayenne pepper"
- " ground white pepper"
- " water as needed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Trim the bulky stems from greens, discard. Chop leaves. You don&#39;t have to cut them down much; greens will cook down to about a quarter of their fresh size. Set aside while getting ready to prep and cook bacon."
- "Heat a large pan on stove top. Chop half a package of bacon. Add to the pan once it&#39;s hot, only cook about half way through. At that point, add about a quarter cup of water to the pot."
- "Add greens a handful at a time. If they don&#39;t all fit in your pot, it&#39;s okay. Add what you can, and put a lid on it. Within a minute or two you&#39;ll be able to stir the rest in thanks to the steam."
- "Add the dry spices. And don&#39;t skimp on the pepper! ;)"
- "Stir well. Add more water at your own discretion as time goes by. I tend to use a grand total of a cup as it cooks. Don&#39;t let the pan burn; steam is key. Keep on stove top on low-med for at least an hour."
