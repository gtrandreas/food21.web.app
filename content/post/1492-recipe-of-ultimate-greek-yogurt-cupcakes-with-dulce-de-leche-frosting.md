If it does come out clean, it is ready."

Beat on low speed for a few seconds until the sugar is well incorporated into the mixture. Then beat on medium high speed until the frosting is fluffy (about 2-4 minutes). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 15-20 minutes."
- "Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, prepare a large pastry bag with extra large couplers and an extra large piping. Fill the bag with the dulce de leche buttercream frosting. Pipe the frosting on each cupcake. Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰"
