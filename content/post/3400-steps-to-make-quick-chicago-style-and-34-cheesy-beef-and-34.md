- "Chicago Italian Beef Sandwiches typically say to soak the cooked meat for a day in the au jus (juice) before  serving, so I cooked mine the day before, it&#39;s so tender it shreds perfectly. Soaked it overnight in the fridge before heating up and serving the next day. The longer it hangs out in the fridge, the better it gets.... Soaking process really brings moisture &amp; flavor into the dry meat."
