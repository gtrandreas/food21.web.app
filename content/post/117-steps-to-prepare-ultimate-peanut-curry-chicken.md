The trailhead sits at the side of the road, burrowing deep into the woods that surround the lake. This recipe is a combination of every peanut curry I&#39;ve ever tried. I didn&#39;t use coconut milk, as I feel that&#39;s a little too sweet and rich with the peanut butter. I loved how this worked out, and I can&#39;t.
