recipeingredient:
- " mushrooms  8 oz size whole or sliced"
- " squash  green"
- " summer squash  yellow"
- " sun dried tomatoes"
- " extra virgin light olive oil"
- " butter"
- " herbs  dill and parsley"
- " lemon pepper"
- " fresh lemon juice"
- " grated parmigiano romano"
- " mini penne pasta"
recipeinstructions:
- "While preparing vegetables set a pot of water on high to boil for pasta."
- "Wash, dry and slice mushrooms in half and then into 1/4&#34; slices. Slice both squashes in half then in 1/4&#34; slices. Slice sun dried tomatoes in 1/4&#34; slices."
- "In a large saute/fry pan (with lid) put about 2-3 tablespoons of oil and 2 pats of butter on medium heat. Once butter melts add mushrooms, herbs and lemon pepper. The mushrooms will absorb all the oil and butter - add more butter a pat at a time until mushrooms have a good coating of butter. Turn the heat down to medium/low, cover and cook about 3-5 minutes until mushrooms start to release their juice."
- "Add a little more olive oil, a pat of butter and stir until the butter has melted.  Then add squash and sun dried tomatoes. Season again with herbs, lemon pepper and add 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon. Stir to incorporate, cover and reduce heat a little. You want to cook the squash until it&#39;s tender but hasn&#39;t lost its color about 2-3 minutes. Then take it completely off the heat; especially if you have an electric stove. Keep it covered."
- "While preparing the vegetables if the water has come to a full boil add the penne and cook as directed on the box. I use mini penne and it takes 6 minutes for al dente. Once cooked drain into colander.  Turn the stove down to medium low, wipe dry the bottom of the pot and return it to stove add about 2 tablespoons of oil, a pat of butter and heat thoroughly. (If you like, add some red pepper flakes.) Add pasta, stir to incorporate - hint: the pasta should have a sheen, if it doesn&#39;t add olive oil a little at a time, stirring in between until it just shines. Once pasta is heated through (it doesn&#39;t take long - a mere few seconds) take the pot off the burner and add as much cheese as you want."
- "Spoon penne, spoon vegetables on top and top with a sprinkling of cheese."
