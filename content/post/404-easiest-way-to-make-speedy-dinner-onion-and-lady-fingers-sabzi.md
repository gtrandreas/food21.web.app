Lady fingers really are most commonly used for tiramisu, but they also work well in any trifle recipe instead of cake or Swiss roll. I suggest you wrap them up and either vacuum seal them or store them in an airtight container. To use from frozen, just defrost at room. Bhindi ki Sabzi and Cabbage Sabzi - Bhindi ki Sabzi is a variation of Masala Bhindi (Spicy Lady fingers) but with added yogurt and minus the spices.
