recipeinstructions:
- "Start by roasting the sweet potatoes in a 400째F oven until they are tender. Set them aside until they are cooled enough for you to handle them. Or you could also cook them in the slow cooker.

- "For the struesel (if using), just combine all the ingredients in a bowl and stir it all together until it&#39;s all moistened and combined."
- "If using the struesel, top with it and bake for 30 minutes. If topping with marshmallows, then bake for the 30 minutes, then place the marshmallows over the top and switch the oven to broil, just until the marshmallows begin to brown. Keep a close eye on them once the broiler is on so as not to burn them."
- "To prepare this in advance, prepare everything through step 3, then cover the baking pan with foil and place in the fridge until ready to bake. Take the pan out of the fridge about 20 minutes before you&#39;re ready to place it in the oven, to bring it back closer to room temperature, then bake as directed."
