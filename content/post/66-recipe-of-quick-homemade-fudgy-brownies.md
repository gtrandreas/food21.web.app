recipeingredient:
- " Brownie Batter"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter"
- "8 oz. semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "3 large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup  2 tbsp all purpose flour"
- "2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips"
- " Frosting"
- "1 3/4 cup confectioners sugar"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature"
- "2 tbsp. heavy cream or half  half"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate together, stirring constantly, until completely smooth. Then, remove from heat and pour the butter and chocolate mix into a large mixing bowl. Set it aside to cool slightly for 10 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9x9&#34; baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang around the edges to easily lift out the finished brownies. Set it aside."
- "Once the butter / chocolate mix has slightly cooled, whisk in the granulated and brown sugar. Then whisk in the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each egg. Whisk in the vanilla."
- "Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Then fold in the chocolate chips."
- "Pour the mix into the prepared baking pan and bake 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs (the toothpick shouldn&#39;t come out clean, that means the brownies are overcooked)."
- "Place the pan onto a wire rack and allow them to cool completely. Once cooled, remove the brownies from the pan (if frosting, now&#39;s the time) and slice them into squares with a sharp knife."
- "For the optional milk chocolate frosting : sift together the confectioners sugar and cocoa powder to ensure there are no lumps. Set that aside. In a medium bowl, cream the butter using a hand held or stand mixer. Gradually add the sugar / cocoa powder mix and the cream and vanilla in batches, then mix until everything is combined and incorporated. Frost the brownies only once they&#39;re completely cooled."
- "Store brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week."
- "Brownies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. To thaw, place them in the refrigerator overnight."
