recipeinstructions:
- "Put 1 cup of oats in the food processor and work until soft. Mix with the rest of the unprocessed oats and put in a mixing bowl."
- "Put almonds in food processor. Work until you have medium sized pieces, for chunkyness and crunchyness. Put in mixing bowl."
- "Add seeds and baking powder and mix."
- "Add egg (whole or just the white) and the almond essence, mix everything together."
- "Add yogurt one tablespoon at a time and mix, until your dough is soft but still hard enough to make a ball that keeps it&#39;s shape. I used most of the cup."
- "Add your favorite sweetener. I used enough to replace 8 teaspoons of sugar, it&#39;s sweet but not much. Feel free to add as much as you prefer."
- "Pre heat the oven at 180 C°. Spread oil on oven tray or cover with aluminum foil."
- "Take little pieces of dough and make small balls, squeeze them against the tray to form 5 cm diameter cookies (size is optional)."
- "Put in oven for 15-20 minutes until they are a bit toasted and crunchy on the outside. Don&#39;t worry if they&#39;re still soft inside, but I prefer to wait til they&#39;re completely dry."
- "Of course, almonds and chia seeds are optional. I recommend adding a nut for crunchyness and a seed for extra fiber, but of course you could add none of these."
