- " Butternut Squash"
- " Tart Apple Granny Smith work well"
- " Heavy Whipping Cream"
- " Chicken Bouillon If you have 2 cups of chicken stock use that in place of the bouillon and water"
- " water"
- " unsalted butter"
- " Sage"
- " ground black pepper"
- " Mild sausage Kielbasa is pictured or chicken cooked"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Read through all directions first! This isn&#39;t a complicated recipe, but one of the steps overlaps another and will save you thirty minutes."
- "Preheat your oven to 350°F."
- "Cut your squash in half, long ways, and remove the seeds."
- "Place in a baking dish and bake for 1 hour, or until a fork easily inserts into the meatiest part."
- "Approximately 20 minutes before your squash is done, place the apple in the baking dish with the squash and bake until the skin splits. You want the meat of the apple to be tender, but not mushy, when done."
- "Once the apple and squash are done baking, use a spoon to scrape the meat of the squash off the skin. I normally let my squash cool about 15 minutes before attempting this. Scrape into a large bowl. You may discard the skin."
- "The skin of the apple should peel off fairly easily. I usually just pull it off. Use a paring knife to slice the remainder of the apple into the bowl with the squash. You may discard the apple peel."
- "This next step will require a mixing bowl, a food processor, or a blender. I used a food processor, but the other two will work just as well. Puree the apple and squash until it has a smooth consistency. Scrape into a medium sized pot."
- "Turn a medium flame on under the pot with the squash and apple mixture and gently whisk in your cream."
- "Add your bouillon and water, or chicken stock, and gently whisk in."
- "Add the remaining ingredients except the meat and salt. Stir"
- "The soup should have a thicker consistency, but not offer much resistance to a stirring spoon. If you feel your soup is too thick, a little bit of milk or water should thin it. If you feel it is too watery, rapidly boil down, whisking the entire time to prevent burning. Much of this is dependent on your personal taste and preferred texture."
- "Add your meat, stirring in slowly with a spoon. Turn your flame to low."
- "Allow the meat and soup to rest for a few minutes before adding salt to taste. I did not add any salt to mine as I found the Kielbasa to be salty enough."
