recipeingredient:
- "4 oz butter"
- "1 1/2 cup sugar"
- "1 1/2 cup milk"
- "1 tbsp golden syrup"
- "1/4 tin of condensed milk"
- "1 handful of crystalised ginger chopped into small pieces"
- "1 cup dessicated coconut"
- "1 packages ginger nut biscuits crushed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place a heavy based, decent sized saucepan on the stove. Cut butter into cubes and melt in pot on a low heat."
- "Once the butter is melted add the sugar and turn the heat to medium. Stir the sugar and the butter for 5 minutes so the sugar absorbs dome heat and the crystals start to dissolve."
- "Then, add all other ingredients to the saucepan. You need to bring the mixture up to the boil, stirring often so the sugar does not burn on the bottom of the pot."
- "Once the mixture is bubbling and nearly doubles in size in the pan, turn the mixture down to medium again. The sugar should hold the heat so it continues to boil gently. If not feel free to turn the element up and down to keep the mixture boiling. IMPORTANT: it needs to boil gently for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure no burn."
- "After the 30 minutes are up, the mixture should have turned light brown. Take off the heat a beat with an electric beater until stiff and glossy."
- "Mix in the crushed ginger nut biscuits and the ginger, pour into a flat, square dish that has been lightly greased with butter and put in the fridge to set."
- "Leave for at least 2-3 hours until properly cooled. Pour the coconut on to a large plate and have another plate on standby for the finished product to sit on."
- "Take a large spoonful of the cold fudge mixture and roll it into a ball between your hands. Then roll the ball in the coconut and set aside on the other plate. Keep rolling until all the mixture is used. Leave the balls in the fridge until ready to eat. Enjoy!"
