recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground beef"
- "1 large egg"
- "1/3 cup bread crumbs"
- "1/3 cup milk"
- "1 tsp dried parsley"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp onion powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "1 tbs olive oil"
- "2 tbs unsalted butter"
- "2 tbs flour"
- "2 cups low sodium beef broth"
- "1 tbs worcestershire sauce"
- "to taste additional salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl blend first 9 ingredients by hand until well combined. Divide mixture into 4 equal portions and form into patties about 1/2-3/4 inch thick (their diameter should be about 3 inches)."
- "Place patties in a single layer on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hr. Remove patties from fridge about 15 minutes before you&#39;re ready to cook."
- "Heat a large, deep sided skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and butter. Swirl to coat skillet. As soon as butter is melted place patties in skillet distributed evenly, edges not touching. Sear 3-4 minutes per side, but not cooking through."
- "When both sides are seared transfer patties to a plate and set aside. Do not drain fat from skillet. Wisk flour into fat. Allow to cook about 1 minute. Wisk in beef broth ensuring no clumps form."
- "Bring gravy to a simmer wisking frequently. When gravy simmers wisk in worcestershire sauce. Continue simmering until gravy begins to thicken. About 5 minutes. Carefully taste and add salt and pepper to personal taste."
- "Return patties to skillet, turning once to coat in gravy. Reduce heat to medium low. Cover and allow to gently simmer about 10 minutes. Flip patties. Cover, turn heat to low and let sit 10 minutes more. This is allowing the patties to soak up some of that gravy flavor while they finish cooking."
- "Your gravy should be on the thin side for this dish. Serve with mashed potatoes (or cauliflower, yum!). Drizzle gravy over patties and potatoes. Enjoy!"
- "See notes and tips below ⤵"
- "Tip: Form patties with edges slightly thicker than the center to avoid the &#34;domed&#34; effect of cooked beef patties."
- "The hour in the fridge is to allow time for the flavors to really blend and develop. If you want to skip this step that is perfectly fine. The flavors just won&#39;t be quite as bold."
- "It is important to not touch or move patties around in skillet until it is time to flip them in order to form that nice crisp, caramelized sear on the meat."
