recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "Sift and add all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt into a bowl."
- "Cut cold butter into small cubes and add to the dry ingredients."
- "With a spatula or dough cutter (or even with a fork) cut butter into small pieces until pea size."
- "When butter is cut and mixed with flour, add cold milk. You&#39;re going to roll the dough into small balls, so add more milk or flour if you&#39;d like."
- "Mix well until all ingredients for the dough are combined."
- "Set the dough to a side, combine cinnamon, granulated sugar, brown sugar in another bowl."
- "Stir it well so cinnamon is evenly distributed."

- "Your cinnamon balls should be golden brown and crispy. If not, bake for couple minutes more."
- "Take them out of oven and set aside to let them cool. While they are cooling, we&#39;ll make the frosting. (But if you prefer to drizzle when the cinnamon balls are hot, make the frosting while baking). Cooling makes the balls to keep crispness even after frosting."
- "Combine softened cream cheese, lemon juice, sugar, milk, and maple syrup(optional) in a bowl."
- "Mix well and check the consistency. You can use an electric hand mixer. But I just used a spatula. You can add more milk or cream cheese for your preferred consistency."
- "Drizzle it over the cinnamon balls."
- "(Secret) you can roll the balls and coat them with remained cinnamon coating mixture before frosting is dried! Extra sugary and yummy!"
