recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup (165 g) brown sugar packed"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter melted"
- "1 egg"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 1/4 cups (155 g) allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "4 oz (110 g) milk or semisweet chocolate chunks"
- "4 oz (110 g) dark chocolate chunk or your preference"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps."
- "Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture."
- "Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies)."
- "Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be."
- "Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
- "Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly."
- "Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown."
- "Cool completely before serving."
