recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat your oven to 350F Sift together the flour, sugar and salt. Add the egg yolk then mix well."
- "Add the butter to the flour then rub it together by hand until it forms a coarse-meal-like texture. Add a splash of milk if the dough is too dry (a tbsp at a time)."
- "Lightly knead the pastry until it forms a dough ball. Wrap it in plastic and let it chill in the fridge for 15mins."
- "Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll the pastry out (about half a centimeter or 1/8 of an inch thick). Butter your 9-inch tart pan then gently transfer the pastry into the pan. Shape it into the bottom and the sides then trim the excess off."
- "Using a fork, poke small holes on the bottom of the crust to prevent it from rising in the middle. Blind bake it by popping it in the preheated oven for 10 minutes or until lightly brown. Take it out and let it cool."
- "For the chocolate fudge: chop your dark chocolate into small pieces then put it in a bowl with the butter and sugar. Gently boil your heavy cream (stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning) then pour it into the bowl."
- "Stir until the chocolate and butter have melted. Let it cool to room temp. Beat the two eggs then add it to the ganache once cooled. Mix it well without aerating (don&#39;t whisk it to prevent incorporating too much air)."
- "Fold-in the flour, a tablespoon at a time, then pour it into your prepared tart shell."
- "Bake it at 350F for 12~15 minutes then let it cool completely at room temperature then chill for at least 2 hours before cutting. Bon appetit."
