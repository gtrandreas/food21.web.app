recipeingredient:
- " Brownie Batter "
- "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter"
- "8 oz. semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup  2 tbsp all purpose flour"
- "2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "3/4 cup Andes baking chips divided"

- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp. peppermint extract"
- "4 drops green liquid food coloring optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate together until completely smooth. Then, remove it from the heat, pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl and set it aside to cool slightly for 10 minutes or so."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9x9&#34; square baking pan lightly with non-stick cooking spray, then line with parchment paper, leaving an overhang to easily lift out the finished brownies and set aside."
- "Whisk the granulated sugar into the chocolate and butter mixture. Then, whisk in the 3 eggs, one at a time, whisking between each one. Whisk in the vanilla extract."
- "Fold in the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Then fold in 1/2 cup of the Andes baking chips. Set the batter aside to prepare the cheesecake layer."
- "For the peppermint cheesecake mixture, in a medium bowl, using a hand-held mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Then beat in the sugar. Once that&#39;s combined, beat in the egg, vanilla extract, peppermint extract and food coloring, if using."
- "Spread a little more than half of the brownie mixture into the prepared baking pan and make sure the whole bottom is evenly covered with batter. Next, spread the peppermint cheesecake mixture over the batter. Drop the remaining brownie batter over the top and use a knife to swirl it into the cheesecake layer. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Andes baking chips evenly over the top."
- "Bake for 32-36 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs. If the toothpick comes out clean, then the brownies are overcooked."
- "Place the pan onto a wire rack and allow the brownies to cook completely. Then cover the pan and move it to the fridge to chill for about 2 hours. Use a large, sharp knife to slice them into squares once they&#39;re chilled. Store them in an airtight container in the fridge."
