recipeingredient:
- "1 (15.25 oz) box red velvet cake mix I used Betty Crocker"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1/2 cup vegetable oil"
- "1 tbs unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1 cup white chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place cake mix, eggs, oil, and cocoa powder in a large bowl. Stir together with a wooden spoon until everything comes together and no dry mix remains."
- "Fold in white chocolate chips to incorporate. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in fridge 30 min - 1 hr to chill. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper."
- "FOR LARGE COOKIES: Scoop out 2 tbs of dough and gently roll into a ball for each cookie. Arrange 6 balls per baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake one sheet at a time! Place in oven and bake 12-16 minutes or until edges are just beginning to crisp and center is still soft (I like mine a little under done so right at 12 was perfect for me)."
- "FOR SMALL COOKIES: Scoop out 1 tbs of dough, form a ball, space out 12 balls per cookie sheet and bake 8-10 minutes (follow same guidelines as large to determine doneness, again only baking 1 sheet at a time)."
- "Remove from oven. Cool on baking sheet 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (or, ya know, sneak a couple with a nice cold glass of milk while still warm). Enjoy!"
