The first time that someone mentioned adding honey to tomatoes, I was a little skeptical. Impress the table with this tangy, yet surprisingly simple glaze. The sweet undertones of balsamic vinegar are brought out by a dash of brown sugar. A honey glaze adds a lovely sweetness to a classic roast chicken. It doesn&#39;t matter what you stuff into it, rub or sprinkle over it or put around it, this timing never.
