- "1 large potato"
- "1-2 pickles"
- "2-3 eggs"
- "1/2 cup onion"
recipeinstructions:

- "Drain the cans of tuna and mix with 1/4 cup of mayo, or until it’s creamy and not hard to mix. Once the tuna is ready, place a thin and even layer of tuna on any desired plate you wish to serve."
- "Peel the potatoes and grate them on top of the tuna with a even layer as well.

You can leave it as is, or smear the mayo all over the potatoes."
- "Thinly slice the pickles and dice into small pieces spreading all over the potatoes and repeating the steps with the mayo by squirting it all over."
- "Grate the carrot and repeat mayo step. Thinly slice and dice the onion and layer it on top of the carrot. Now separate the white and yolk from the egg and grate the whites on a smaller grater size all over the mimosa, and final step would be to grate the yolk on the same small grater size."
