- " Individual Apple Pies"
- "1 package Pie Crusts top  bottom  have at room temperature before baking"
- "6 large Granny Smith Apples sliced"
- "1/4 cup Raisins optional"
- "1 tsp Ground Cinnamon"
- "1 tsp Vanilla Extract"
- "1/2 tsp Allspice"
- "1 tsp Lemon Juice"
- "3/4 cup Brown Sugar packed"
- "1 tsp Granulated Sugar topping"
- "1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon topping"
- "2 tbsp Cornstarch for thickening"
- " Kitchen Items"
- "2 Oversized Ramekins"
- "1 Cutting Board"
- "1 Knife"
- "1 medium Pot"
- "1 large Spoon"
- "1 Strainer"
- "1 can Butter Flavored Pam Spray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash apples, thin slice, cut the seeds out and discard them. There&#39;s no need to peel apples."
- "Place apple slices in a pot and fill with enough water to cover."
- "Bring to a boil and cook apples until they are soft. Usually about 10 minutes."
- "Once soft, drain in strainer and place apples back in warm pot. Turn heat on low."
- "Mix in all ingredients except for pie crust, cinnamon topper and granulated sugar topper."
- "Using one of your empty ramekins, turn it over and cut out a circle of pie crust the size of your ramekin openings. Make 2 of those rounds. Lightly spray Pam the insides and bottom of your ramekins. Also make 2 more rounds that are slightly larger than your first ones. These will be your pie toppers."
- "To thicken your sliced apple mixture, add 2 tablespoons Cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. With heat turned on, slowly add in cornstarch and water mixture. Your mixture will thicken up as it heats up."
- "Taste test to see if you&#39;d like more sugar or cinnamon. It&#39;s all up to you!"
- "Place both pie rounds in each ramekin and press down."
- "Using a fork, make holes in the crust."
- "Fill both ramekins equally with pie filler."
- "Place pie toppers on top and pinch down on to your ramekins."
- "Spray tops with butter flavored Pam or real melted butter and sprinkle evenly with cinnamon and sugar toppers."
- "Place a few slits on top so your pie can breathe, cook and bubble over if need be. Place pies on the lowest rack setting [this will ensure your bottom crust to crisp up] in your oven at approximately 425°."
- "Bake as per pie crust manufactures directions. Usually 15 to 17 minutes."
- "Serve hot with an ice cream of your choosing!"
- "Authors Notes: Another gorgeous way of presenting these pies is to slice off the apple top, hollow out the apples contents with a spoon or melon baller, [being careful not to breach the outer apple shell] and cook the innards just as you would have the apple slices. Also, make certain that the apples you choose can stand upright on their own. Lastly, cut raw pie crusts in strips and lay across the apple top interwoven like a lattice fence."
- "Lastly, chances are these pies will boil over a bit in between the ramekin top and the top pie crust. So place a cookie sheet or tinfoil underneath the ramekins to catch any dripping fluids. However, one way to avoid this is by cutting out a long, 1/2&#34; piece of raw pie crust and press it [inside] the top, [upper] rim of your ramekin. As it bakes, it will rise into your top crust whereby giving it a better seal."
