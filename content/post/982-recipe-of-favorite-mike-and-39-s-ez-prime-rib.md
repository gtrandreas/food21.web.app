- "1/3 cup Minced Garlic"
- "1 tbsp Cracked Black Pepper"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Onion Powder"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Rosemary"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Thyme"

- " sides Creamed Spinach"
- " sides Wedge Salad"
- " sides Fresh Steamed Asparagus"
- " sides Seafood why not make it a surf  turf"
- "2 Packets Au Jus Sauce  2 cups beef broth with sodium  McCormick is a great brand  fresh parsley for garnish"
- " Kitchen Equipment"
- "1 large Disposable Aluminum Roasting Pan"
- "1 large Metal Roasting Rack"
- "1 Quality Meat Thermometer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring roast to room temperature for at least 2 hours prior to cooking."
- "Rinse roast and daub dry. Place on a metal rack in a roasting pan - fat side up. Leave binding strings in tact."
- "Mix all dry seasonings together in a bowl. Place minced garlic and oil in a separate bowl."
- "● Rinse your roast and pat it completely dry with absorbent paper towels.   ● Coat your roast in your oil and garlic mixture. Use all.   ● Then, pat on your dry seasonings all the way around.    ● Know that no salt is needed in your rub since your Au Jus with beef broth will lend all the sodium you&#39;ll want."
- "● Do not cover roast and cook on a lifted oven rack at 400° for the first 15 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 325° and time for 20 minutes per total pound.   ● This will give you a nice medium rare center and well done ends.   ● Cut time by 3 minutes per pound if you want a very rare center like I do.   ● An ultimate internal temp of 120° stuck in your thickest roast part makes for a perfect rare prime rib in my opinion."
- "● Pull roast from oven and let it rest for 5 + covered for minutes before slicing. This will help its fluids to rise to the surface.   ● Cut binding strings.   ● Slice in between bones and serve as 1 lb slabs per guest.  ● Serve with piping hot Au Jus and chilled Horseradish Sauce."
- "Make your Au Jus but substitute the water called for with beef broth for a more pronounced beef flavor."
- "● Upon serving, I&#39;ll lay the 1 lb slab on a guests serving plate alone. Then, I&#39;ll ladle piping hot Au Jus around the meat. I&#39;ll then garnish individual slabs with fresh parsley.   ● Any other sides - I&#39;ll serve in seperate bowls or on side plates. [i.e., stacked baked potatoes, fresh asparagus, creamed spinach with bread, garlic risotto, or, simple wedge salads]  ● You can also serve this as an impressive Surf &amp; Turf dish. Just add steamed seafood of your choosing to the side. I&#39;ll commonly add King Crab Legs, Jumbo Shrimp or, Jumbo Scallops."
- "● Steam de-thawed crab legs for 5 to 8 minutes in a slight amount of water, lemon juice, pepper corns, a bay leaf and crushed garlic cloves to taste.   ● Serve legs with melted or clarified butter and lemon wedges."
- "● Another great side is baked potatoes.  ● See my recipe for Mike&#39;s Perfect Baked Potatoes."
- "Creamed Spinach. Another great side dish. Quite traditional!"
- "Rare Prime Rib with a dark Au Jus and chilled Horseradish pictured below."

- "Any leftovers can easily make an incredible New Orleans Old Sober, aka, Yakamein Soup. Check that recipe out in my personal recipes under Mike&#39;s Old Sober Soup. It&#39;s absolutely one of my wife&#39;s, friends and neighbors favorite soups!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340687-mikes-traditional-old-sober-soup"
