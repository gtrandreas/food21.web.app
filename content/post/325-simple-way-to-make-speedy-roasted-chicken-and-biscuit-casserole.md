- "Use a scoop to evenly drop the biscuit dough over the top."
- "Place the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake uncovered for about and hour... this is all based on how your oven cooks. You&#39;re looking for a good color on the biscuits, the sauce bubbling and the underside of the biscuits to not be raw."
