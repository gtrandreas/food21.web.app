- "The coat is not supposed to drip on the oil because once you stick it in, the coating will be held together by the heat, leave each one or two for about 3-4 minutes or till it Browns, if you feel it&#39;s browning too fast at any point of frying them, lower the heat"
- "If you put two together make sure they don&#39;t come close to each other. And if you keep it long enough the hotdogs cook well and expand it&#39;s alright."
