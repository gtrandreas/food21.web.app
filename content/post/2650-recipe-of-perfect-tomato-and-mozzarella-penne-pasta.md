recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute. Remember that 1 clove is about 1 or 2 tsp. Be careful not to burn it!"
- "Pour garlic and oil into a large bowl. This should be the bowl where everything eventually goes into."
- "Fill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Cook your penne. While this cooks, this is a good time to cut your tomatoes and mozzarella into diced pieces. If you can find the mozzarella that is already in &#34;pearl&#34; form, that makes things easier."
- "Put your diced tomatoes, salt, and basil in the large bowl."
- "Put diced mozzarella in a smaller, separate bowl. Pour in a little bit of olive oil - just enough to coat them. Believe me, this is important, unless you want all of the mozzarella to stick in one big clump.."
- "Once pasta is cooked, strain and pour it into the large bowl. Immediately, you&#39;ll want to add in the mozzarella and stir it all up while the noodles are hot."
- "Stir thoroughly. Add parmesan and red pepper flakes to taste."
- "Optional: If you can get your hands on fig balsamic glaze, this is a very nice addition to add some sweetness to it."
- "Can be served hot or cold. I like it hot, my dad likes it cold, so it&#39;s really just a matter of opinion. Enjoy!"
- "Also, you could add some baby spinach leaves, if you want some greens!"
