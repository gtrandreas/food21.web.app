recipeingredient:
- "2 Sweet Potatoes"
- "2 Tablespoons Butter Melted"
- "2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar"
- "2 Tablespoons Butter Melted"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375"
- "Wash and peel the Sweet Potatoes, cube them up into roughly two inch chunks – you’re going for uniformity here, try to get all the chunks roughly the same size so they bake evenly."
- "Pam spray a baking sheet and toss your potato chunks on there. Pour your first portion of 2TBSP melted butter over the potatoes and push them around to try and get them all coated a bit."
- "Bake for around 35 minutes – keep an eye on them for burning and make sure to stir them once in a while. Browning is good, burning is not :-)"
- "When they’re done, take them out of the oven and decide how you’re going to mash them! You can use a food processor or a blender(if you have one) to puree them, you can just pour them into a bowl and smoosh them with a large fork or a potato masher if you like. It all ends up pretty much the same."
- "After you’ve mashed up the potatoes, add the remaining 2 TBSP melted butter and the 2 TBSP of Brown Sugar and mix it all together."
- "Enjoy!!"
