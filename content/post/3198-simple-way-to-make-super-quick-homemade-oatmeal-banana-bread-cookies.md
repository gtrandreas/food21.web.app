recipeinstructions:
- "Put oatmeal and bananas in a medium bowl, and mush the bananas into the oatmeal, using a fork."
- "In a separate bowl, mix butter, cinnamon, sugar, and brown sugar until evenly blended. (I heated mine in the microwave for about 10-15seconds, so the butter was warm, and helped devolve the sugars better.)"
- "Add the egg and vanilla. Whisk until texture is smooth."
- "Add the flour and baking soda to the banana/oatmeal mixture. Mix together evenly."
- "Pour the liquid mixture onto the flour/oatmeal - mix together until texture is a little bit more runny than cookie dough.

You don&#39;t want it too doughy tho, it&#39;s suppose to be a little runny."
- "Add raisins or nuts now, if you want. Preheat oven to 350?F."
- "Using a tablespoon, drop cookies onto a non stick cookie sheet, or lightly greased one. (The tablespoon will drop them into little balls, keep them that shape, the heat of the oven will form them into cookies.)"
- "Bake for 14-18 minutes. When the edges become a golden brown they&#39;re ready. Cool them on a wire rack for a couple minutes, and enjoy! xox"
