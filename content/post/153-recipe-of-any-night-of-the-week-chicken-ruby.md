- "1 Tinned Tomatoes"
- "1 Tin Coconut Milk"
- "1 Whole Chilli"
- "1/2 Butternut Squash"
- "4 Chicken Legs"
- "100 g Greek Yogurt"
- "Handful Coriander"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the 10 first ingredients (all whole spices) and place them in a dry, heavy based pan that can go in the oven. Place over a low heat and warm the spices through until the seeds start popping"
- "Tip into a pestle &amp; mortar (or a spice grinder) and add half of each of the next four dry ingredients, and grind into a fine powder- if you like some seeds in the curry leave a little course."
- "Finely dice the onions and fry in the coconut oil over a low heat until they begin to caramelise- add a touch more oil if necessary but try to keep this to a minimum. When the onions are browning and the oil begins to seperate from the onion add half of the ginger and garlic (both grated) and fry again until the oil begins to seperate."
- "Add in the ground spices, mix into the onions and cook over the low heat until the oil seperates again. Squeeze in half the juice of a lemon to deglaze the pan and add the tomato puree, cook this out for a couple of minutes."
- "Add in the tinned tomatoes, coconut milk and whole chilli and bring to a low summer, cooking for around 20 minutes. At this point check for seasoning and adjust if necessary."
- "Peel and chop the squash into inch sized chunks and add to the curry. Simmer for another 40 minutes to an hour and check heat levels. If a little hot, sweetness or acidity will help to balance it out but if you like a bit more spice then add some dried chilli"
- "To prepare the chicken, remove the skin if still on, cut off the knuckles, crack the other joint and make some deep scores in the meat."
- "Mix the remaining ginger, garlic, lemon juice and spices to the yogurt and add the chicken before placing in a large food bag. Leave to marinade for at least 1 hour but overnight is best."
- "I would suggest doing all of this at least a day before you want to eat- the curry spices will become richer and more balanced, whilst the chicken will tenderise and take on the marinades flavour."
- "To finish the cooking, remove the chicken from the marinade and wipe of the excess. Seal the chicken in a hot pan or on a grill plate before adding to the curry sauce. Cook in a hot oven for an hour and add some freshly chopped coriander before serving."
