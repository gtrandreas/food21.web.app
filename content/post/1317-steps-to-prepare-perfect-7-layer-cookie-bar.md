recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup Crisco butter"
- "1 cup Honey Maid Graham cracker crumbs"
- "1 can 14 oz Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 packages Nestle or Hershey semi sweet chocolate chips"
- "1 packages Reeses peanut butter chips"
- "1 1/2 cup Bakers Angel Flake Sweetened Coconut flakes"
- "1/2 cup chopped walnuts"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "Place 1/2 cup butter in a 8 1/2 by 13 inch pan and place in oven as it is preheating. Wait for butter to melt (app. 5 mins)."
- "Remove pan with melted butter from oven. Add graham cracker crumbs to melted butter. I eyeball the crumbs so you may have to add more if the entire bottom of the pan 8 not completely and evenly covered with the crumbs. You should have a nice and even layer of crumbs that will be your base."
- "Pour the entire can of sweetened condensed milk onto the crumbs. I usually get the 14 Oz Eagle Brand.... it is by far the best brand to use. If you want to cut fat, use the low fat version instead. Make sure to pour milk evenly onto the crumbs."
- "This is the fun part....  use 1/2 the bag of semi sweet chips.... just sprinkle the chips evenly across the milk. You can vary the type of chips if you want."
- "Now sprinkle 1/2 the bag of peanut butter chips on top to create a nice layer of chocolaty &amp; peanut buttery goodness."
- "Layer the coconut flakes on top of the chips. You can add more flakes.... I love coconut so I actually use 2 to 3 cups."
- "Sprinkle the remaining semi chocolate and peanut butter chips on top of the coconut flakes. Make sure it is distributed evenly across the pan."
- "Now add the chipped walnuts. Sprinkle evenly on top."
- "Using a spatula, press down firmly on the bars. This will pack the chips, coconut and nuts into the sweetened condensed milk and graham cracker crumbs."
- "Place the pan in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. The coconut should be toasted once done."
- "Now let the bars cool, at least 2 hours or overnight to let set. If you cut the bars too soon, you will end up with a gooey mess. Still yummy, but you will not achieve the cookie bar results unless you are patient and wait."
- "When completely cooled, cut the cookie into bars. Makes about 24 bars."
