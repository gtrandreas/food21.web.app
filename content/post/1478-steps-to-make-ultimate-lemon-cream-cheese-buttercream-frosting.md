recipeingredient:
- " 4 c Confectioners Sugar add more for a firmer frosting"
- " 1 c Unsalted Butter softened"
- " 12 c Lemon Curd I used an entire 10 oz jar"
- " 1 12 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract"
- " 4 oz Cream Cheese"
- " Lemon Yellow Wilton Icing Coloring optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a stand mixer, (or even with a hand mixer) cream together all the wet ingredients until smooth and creamy. Gradually add in the confectioners sugar. If you want the frosting firmer, (mainly for decorating purposes) add a little more confectioners sugar at a time until you achieve the consistency you want."
- "As you can see in the photo, due to the extra lemon curd, combined with refrigerating the night before and allowing it to resoften before use, mine came out a little bit glossy. I&#39;m not 100% sure, but I don&#39;t believe this would be considered a &#34;crusting buttercream,&#34; as it stayed soft and creamy after sitting out at room temperature while we finished cooking then ate dinner. It was exposed to the air for about an hour and a half or so. Nonetheless, this frosting tastes so dreamy!!! 💛💛💛💛💛"
