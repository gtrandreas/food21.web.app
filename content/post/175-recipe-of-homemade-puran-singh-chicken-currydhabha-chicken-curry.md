- "Once the tomatoes cook add marinated chicken and cook it at high flame till chicken colour changes. Next add the spice powder mix and lower the flame. Keep moving the chicken so that the spice mix gets evenly distributed. I also added some chopped coriander leaves and mixed the contents nicely."
- "Now add water to the pan. Chicken should only slightly dunk in the water. Cover the pan and cook for total 25 minutes moving the chicken occasionaly. At the end of 25 minutes I added fenugreek leaves, some cooking cream and some butter. Cook for another 5 minutes."
- "Garnish with Coriander leaves and serve with rice or bread."
