recipeingredient:
- "500 g fat free Greek yoghurt"
- "300 g fresh strawberries"
- " Approximately 120g honey"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash your strawberries and add them to a food processor and pulse them so you get some blitzed and some that are chopped bits. I like the consistency but you can blitz fully if you prefer a smoother consistency."
- "In the same processor add the tub of Greek yoghurt and honey and swirl through. You may wish to start with less honey and taste as you go. I prefer it sightly sweeter so used more. I didnâ€™t mix it fully as I liked a ripple effect with the yoghurt and strawberries. Transfer to a ceramic dish and cover with cling film and transfer to the freezer for approx 4 hours. Stir with a spoon every 30-40 mins and re cover with cling film."
- "To serve I used an ice cream scoop dipped in hot water and you get a nice scoop effect ðŸ¥°"
