I received a really nice comment from a reader of another cheap dinner One Pot Creamy Spaghetti is absolutely the easiest and cheapest meal I make and I&#39;ve made it.

I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that&#39;s gives the dish more flavor and they&#39;re still tender and moist. Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Meanwhile brown ground beef in a large skillet, drain off grease. Add spaghetti, tomatoes, broth, cream and pepper flakes; heat to boiling. This baked spaghetti recipe might take a while to complete, but the result is worth the time and I prepared this creamy baked spaghetti by first cooking the spaghetti.
