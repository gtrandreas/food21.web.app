- "Place on medium heat and stir constantly. When this mixture starts to boil quit stirring and set timer for 10 minutes."
- "After 10 minutes check temperature or do soft ball test. Soft ball test is just dropping some of the mixture in a cup of cold water. Temperature should be 234 degrees or a soft ball from your test. If done, remove from heat. Otherwise, continue cooking while testing every 2 minutes.

- "After 8 minutes add any nuts or marshmallows to the mixture. Stir for 2-3 minutes. Fudge will still be shiny but beginning to feel firmer. Pour into buttered pan and allow to cool."
- "After fudge cools cut into pieces. Should make 32 or so pieces. Approximately 1 1/2 lbs."
