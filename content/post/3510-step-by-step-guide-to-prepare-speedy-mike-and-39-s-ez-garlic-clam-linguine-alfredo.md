- "If using raw clams, scrub your shells and pull any beards. In a separate pan, place your butter and white wine. Bring to a simmer. Add your shelled clams and tightly cover. Simmer until all clams have opened. About 3 minutes if raw. If any do not open, disgard them. They&#39;re bad. If employing pre-steamed, steam for 1 minute or until heated."
- "A, &#34;stand alone,&#34; presentation by one of my newer, less adventurous students who just couldn&#39;t bring herself to eat or even touch actual shellfish. ;0)"
- "Serve pasta hot with warm fresh bread and butters to the side. Garnish dish with steamed clams, fresh parsley and shreaded Parmasean cheese. Enjoy!"
