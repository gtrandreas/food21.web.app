recipeingredient:
- "2/3 cup cocao powder"
- "1 cup coconut sugar"
- "1/4 tsp sea salt"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "1 cup all natural unsalted almond butter"
- "1/2 cup aquafaba chickpea water"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup vegan mini chocolate chips"
- "1/2 cup sea salt caramel chips optional"
- "1/2 cup macadamia nuts optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F."
- "In a large bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients: cacao powder, coconut sugar, baking soda, sea salt, and set aside."
- "In a medium bowl, mix together almond butter, aquafaba, and vanilla extract."
- "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients until fully combine with a nice doughy texture. (Mix preferably using a fork or mixing spatula)"
- "Stir in the chocolate chips, sea salt caramel chips, and macadamia nuts"
- "Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop the dough into balls (approx. 2 tbsp per ball) and place on baking sheet a few inches apart from each other. This mixture will spread, so evenly space only 8 to 10 cookie balls per baking sheet."
- "Bake at 350 degrees F. for 10-11 minutes. In the oven the rounies will rise well, but once removed they will fall into nice thin and crispy, yet soft rounies. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking tray for 10 minutes. While hot these rounies are very delicate, so I prefer to slides the parchment sheet with the entire batch of cookies still on it to the wire rack for cooling."
- "Additionally, these rounies are so moist that the tend to sick together when stacked, so I cut squares of wax or parchment paper to use as individual separaters for the rounies."
