recipeingredient:
- " collards about 12 big leafs"
- " ground beef"
- " small onion"
- " cooked white rice"
- " Old Bay Hot"
- " Salt  Pepper"
- " beef broth if not using collard stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook rice. Set to the side and let cool."
- "While rice is cooling, wash your collards in cool water. You can either keep your collards whole, or if they&#39;re super big you can cut them in half. Either way you need leafs about the size of your hand. Make sure to cut stem off as well. I learned cutting the greens horizontally is better than how I cut mine in the pic."
- "Get a pot with the collard stock in it and set it to high until it starts to boil. If not using collard stock use salted water."
- "Blanch (boil) your greens for 2-3 minutes. Just enough to make them flexable."
- "After 2-3 minutes put your collards in ice cold water to stop the cooking process. I fill my sink up with water and transfer them from the boiling water to the sink with a wooden spoon."
- "In a heavy bottom nonstick pan brown your hamburger meat."
- "Cut up your onion and cook with the meat. DO NOT DRAIN MEAT!! Use about 3 tablespoons of Old Bay (I use a little more) and salt and pepper to season meat while its cooking."
- "When meat is browned pour in 1 cup of collard stock (or 1 cup beef broth) into the pan, fold in your rice and let cook down until the liquid is almost gone. About 10 minutes."
- "Spoon meat mixture into top part of collard leaf and roll up like a burrito. Place rolls in a 9x13 baking dish, seam sides down. If you have to double roll the wraps it&#39;s ok."
- "Continue until you either run out of mixture or collards. If you have left over mixture spoon it on top of rolls, if you have extra collards continue to cook them and use them as your &#34;side&#34;."
- "Pour stock (or beef broth) into dish until the wraps are 1/3 way covered."
- "Cover tightly with foil and cook for 40 minutes on 350°."
- "After 40 minutes uncover and lightly salt top of rolls. Place back in oven uncovered for 10 minutes. Serve hot!"
