recipeinstructions:

Add the mayo to the cooled chicken and mix well. You could add some nuts/ dried fruits for a crunch at this stage like slivered almonds or dried cranberries."
- "We prefer to use ciabatta rolls, to whole wheat bread slices. Apply coriander chutney on to the slice along with a generous portion of the chicken mayo mixture. I prefer to use medium cheddar cheese slice, provolone/ spicy pepper jack is also a good option.Place the sandwich in a panini press and cook till the cheese melts and the sandwich is crispy but not too tough. Enjoy with your favorite salad."
