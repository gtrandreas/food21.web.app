recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the eggplant and cut one side to make flat surface. This will stabilize your eggplant when you slice it. Slice the eggplant thinly."
- "Now salt the eggplant slices on both sides set in a bowl to drain the liquids. Doing this take all or most of the bitterness out of the eggplant slices. After an hour drain the liquids off and they are ready to use. The last picture on this step is the bitter liquids pulled out by the salt. I had about 1/2 cup total, on second draining."

- "Repeat the the same layers except you shouldn&#39;t have pesto on second layer. Add the shredded cheese on top. Put into the oven for 45 minutes."
- "Take out of oven and let rest 15 minutes. Serve I hope you enjoy!!!!"

Great for a gluten-free lasagna option or just for sneaking in a. This is better than the classic, trust us on this one… Lasagna is a go-to dish for our family and, while it&#39;s full of tomatoes and tastes delicious, it doesn&#39;t have that much going for it in regards to healthy eating. Some eggplant lasagna recipes ask you to grill the eggplant slices instead. While this imparts a nice smoky flavor, I find that grilling individual slices is Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
