I probably get more requests for Indian food than any other ethnic cuisine, so I was very excited to be posting this chicken tikka. This Chicken Masala Curry however, unlike Chicken Tikka Masala that most people here in the west eat with rice…is best served up with Naan (here&#39;s my recipe to make Naan at home).
