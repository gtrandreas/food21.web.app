recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup Almonds"
- "4 oz Butter"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 cup Chocolate chips"
- "1/4 tsp Salt"
- "1 1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 tbsp Vanilla extract"
- "3/4 Brown sugar"
- "1 cup Flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Butter a 9 inch springform pan and line the base with parchment paper."
- "Spread the almonds in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes until the papery skins look cracked."
- "Allow to cool just slightly and then gather the still warm nuts in a kitchen towel. Rub the nuts in the towel in a circular motion on a countertop to remove the bitter, papery skins. There may be some nuts that you need to pick out and rub individually and keep in mind, for this recipe, a bit of the skin left is fine. Once the skins have been (mostly) removed transfer the nuts to a cutting board and coarsely chop and then set aside."
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside."
- "Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the beater and bowl with a rubber spatula and add the egg. Beat until the egg is well incorporated and then add the teaspoon of vanilla. Combine well."
- "Add in the flour mixture and mix until just combined and a few dry streaks of flour remain. Remove from the mix and using a rubber spatula fold in the chocolate chips and almonds."
- "Transfer the batter into the prepared springform pan and using an offset spatula smooth the batter into an even layer."
- "Bake until slightly golden 25 minutes or until a wooden skewer comes out clean when placed in the centre of the batter. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack."
- "To un-mold, run a knife around the edge of the pan and release the springform ring. Invert the pastry onto a large plate or platter and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment paper. Invert again onto a cutting board to cut into slices."
- "Top with strawberries and sprinkles if desired!"
