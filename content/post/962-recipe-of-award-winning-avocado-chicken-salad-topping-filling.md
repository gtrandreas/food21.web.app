recipeinstructions:
- "Combine first six ingredients.    For some texture and crunch, I used carrots and jicama (singkamas).  I like tomatoes so added some cherry tomatoes too as garnish."
- "Squeeze your lemon (or lime) sparingly, and adjust to taste. It can over power the avocado.  Don&#39;t use calamansi because it&#39;s too strong.   Add dash chili powder, whatever kind you have. (Optional)  Season with salt and pepper according to your liking.  Mix."
- "I added a few drops of Kewpie&#39;s roasted sesame dressing because i needed bolder flavours.  Just having avocado, chicken, and lime can be subtle in taste."
