- "Drain on paper towels then serve atop T-Bone Steaks."
- "STEAK FRYING &amp; TIPS: Choose a T-bone steak that is cherry red and is well marbled. [meaning fat runs equally throughout the meat] Have your Butcher choose your steaks if you&#39;re not certain on which cuts to pick."
- "Pat your steaks down with a paper towel and make sure your steaks are dry. You don&#39;t want to end up steaming them instead."
- "Important! Do not tenderize T-Bones with a fork or puncture your meat in any way both prior to or during frying. You&#39;ll forfit vital juices and actually cause your steak to firm up even more.

Do not over season your steaks with spices such as meat seasoned salt, tenderizers, garlic or onion powders as you&#39;ll only mask the natural flavor of your meat. Garlic will also burn at a high heat so do not use in seasonings. Salt and pepper are all you really need!"
- "Season with sea salt just minutes before frying. Otherwise it will dry your steak out. Remember, you want juicy steaks!"
- "To pan-sear T-bone steaks, use a cast iron frying pan [best] or an equally heavy pan. Heat the pan over medium to high heat with 2 tbsp high heat oil vegetable oil until pan is almost smoking. Be careful not burn oil though."
- "Quickly sear the steaks on each side for about 1 minute to achieve a hearty brown crust then fry for 3 to 6 minutes on each side depending if you want rare, medium rare, medium well or well done steaks."
- "Use tongs [important] to flip your steaks or to move them around so they don&#39;t stick or become punctured by a fork or knife."
- "When steaks are done to your liking, set to the side and let rest for 5 - 7 minutes before cutting."
- "FOR BAKED POTATOES:                            Wash and dry your potatoes and stick a knife x 2 through both for quicker baking time. Generously coat both with hardened bacon grease. Sprinkle each with cracked black pepper and sea salt."
- "Roll in tinfoil and press tightly then roll again in another piece of tinfoil."
- "Place in oven at 425° on the lowest oven shelf for 45 minutes."
- "Cut open potatoes and squeeze both ends together to push up baked centers."
- "Top with garlic butter or plain butter and sour cream and garnish with cracked black pepper and chives."
- "PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED ASPARAGUS: Add olive oil to the spears and add cracked pepper, sea salt, garlic and Parmesan Cheese and mix well."
- "Carefully wrap asparagus spears in Prosciutto and place on tinfoil lined and spray Pam cookie sheet."
