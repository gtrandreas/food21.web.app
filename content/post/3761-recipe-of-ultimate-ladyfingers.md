- "Beat in the vanilla extract. Sift the flour, salt and baking powder over the batter. Do not mix at this stage."
- "In a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar(you can also use a pinch of salt or 2-3 drops of lemon juice) on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup white sugar and whip until stiff peaks form and the whites are glossy."

- "After the ladyfingers have been piped, place the powdered sugar in a fine strainer, and lightly sift the sugar over the tops of the cookies."
- "Bake for about 8-10 minutes or until the ladyfingers are firm but lightly brown and are still soft and spongy when lightly pressed"
- "Remove the baking sheets from the oven and immediately slide the parchment paper (with the ladyfingers) from the baking sheet onto a wire rack."
- "Let the ladyfingers cool for a minute and then remove the each ladyfinger from the parchment paper, using a flat spatula or knife, and let cool completely. (These tend to stick and are hard to remove without breaking if left longer)"
