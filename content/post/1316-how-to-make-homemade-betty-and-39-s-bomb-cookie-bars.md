Cookie butter is very much akin to peanut butter - similar consistency and color. The rich gingerbread flavor actually comes from the so-called &#34;Speculoos cookie,&#34; a crunchy Belgian. At Baking Betty&#39;s we hand craft cookies, pastries and ice cream, all made from scratch and baked fresh throughout the day. She learned all the family recipes, including her grandmother&#39;s specialty, the classic chocolate chip cookie, one of Baking Betty&#39;s favorites. Adorable hand crafted bath bombs made with all natural ingredients including kaolin clay, apricot oil and buttermilk powder to create the foam.
