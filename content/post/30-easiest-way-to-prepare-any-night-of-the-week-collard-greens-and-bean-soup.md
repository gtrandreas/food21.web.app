recipeinstructions:
- "You may chose to add more or less beans depending on how thick you like the soup as well with the greens. I prefer this soup with lots of greens and reasonably thick. You can add potatoes to make the soup thicker aswell but I chose not too."

- "Place the greens in a bowl, 5-10 minutes before cooking add lukewarm water to the greens."
- "In another saucepan bring water to the boil. Add the cabbage to the water once it has started to boil. Press down with a spoon to submerge as much of the greens as possible. Boil for 5-6 minutes pressing down with the spoon often."

Great Northern beans, chopped yellow onion, white wine, garlic, and fresh thyme give this soup incredible flavor. For a weeknight supper, serve with slices of crusty bread spread with goat cheese. Add the collard greens and stir-fry until they start to wilt and soften. Mash some of the beans against the sides of the pan to thicken the soup slightly. Stir in the chopped parsley and remaining rosemary.
