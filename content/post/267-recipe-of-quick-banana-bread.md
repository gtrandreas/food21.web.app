- "Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and fold with a spatula. (Dont over mix and dont keep the mixture for too long either as you&#39;ve added the baking soda)."
- "Scoop the mixture about halfway in the loaf tins. You can add some banana slices or nuts on the top for decoration."
- "Bake @ 180 degrees Celsius or 350 F for about 30 minutes in the second rack of the oven and then check with a toothpick. For the bread to be completely done, the toothpick should come out clean."
- "In the end, once it&#39;s almost baked, after sort of about 30 mins, shift it to the middle or the fourth rack and turn on the upper grill and give it like 5 mins for some colour to appear on it. When the toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done"
- "(This recipe could potentially take you longer than 30 minutes depending on the size of the loaf so checking with a toothpick is crucial)."
- "Glaze the top of the bread with butter or butter plus jam as soon as it&#39;s done for added softness."
