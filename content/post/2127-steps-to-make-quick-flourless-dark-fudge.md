recipeingredient:
- " salted butter"
- " granulated or raw sugar"
- " dark alkalineprocessed cocoa Hersheys works"
- " large eggs each must fill a 18 c measure 4 if less"
- " whole milk cow or nut NOT grain milk like rice"
- " unwhipped whole whipping cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the butter into Tbs, approx, so it melts faster, put the pieces into a 1 qt sauce pan on med heat. Meanwhile, measure out the cocoa, crack your eggs and measure your dairy or milks. If you don&#39;t have whipping cream, use a half cup of whole milk."
- "When the butter is bubbling, use a 2&#34; whisk to mix the sugar into it and add the cocoa. Mix completely. It&#39;s going to be very grainy! Keep mixing."
- "At this point you can begin preheating your oven to 350째F (180째C). Now take the pot off the heat and begin adding the milk in a bit at a time. The mass of chocolate will separate but DON&#39;T stop mixing! Keep adding the milk, approximately a Tbs at a time until it&#39;s ALL mixed in. By the time the last of it goes in you&#39;ll see a smooth, silky sauce. If not, don&#39;t worry, begin adding an egg and keep mixing until it disappears, and so on until they&#39;re ALL gone."
- "Only grease an 8 x 8 (square) pan. You can also add parchment but it&#39;s not necessary. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and use a spatula to make sure not a single drop gets left behind in the pot!"
- "The original instructions said to bake for 25 minutes but it didn&#39;t indicate how big the pan was and I took mine out and it was STILL REALLY raw! After another 25 minutes it was perfect so I&#39;ll say 50 minutes cooking time and a clean skewer or tooth pick or whatever you use to check your cakes should come out clean."
- "Cut pieces in the pan. If you used parchment, remove with the paper to a cooling rack before cutting it on a plate."
