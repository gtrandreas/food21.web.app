recipeinstructions:
- "Please note that the pictures were taken while making half of this cake."

- "While baking, boil or microwave 1-2 cups of water and dissolve 1-2 tablespoons of sugar (proportionately 1 cup/1 tablespoon).

- "Once completed, repeat this process for each layer of cake placed on top. (I‚Äôm hesitant to do more than two total layers because it‚Äôs so saturated.) Place in refrigerator to cool."
- "Once cool, use the remaining frosting to frost the cake. (You can trim cake first if you‚Äôd like.) Add sprinkles or decorations! Enjoy!"
