recipeingredient:
- "1 large beefsteak tomato or 2 Roma types finely chopped and mashed up with a fork"
- "1 small clove garlic"
- "7 leaves fresh basil finely chopped plus a whole leaf or two for garnish you can use 14 to 12 teaspoon dry basil"
- "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to start"
- " olive oil"
- " lemon or balsamic if needed for more tartness"
recipeinstructions:
- "After you chop your tomatoes, either take the back of a fork and mash them up a bit or use your knife in a rocking action to mash them. Doing this will give your dip some thickness and body to stick to your bread."
- "Put the tomatoes in a medium bowl and grate a small clove (or half a regular one) into the bowl. Preferable to grate rather than chop so you don&#39;t get chunks of garlic in the mixture."
- "Add salt and chopped basil, stir, give it a taste, and adjust seasoning if needed."
- "Pour a good glug or two of olive oil into the bowl (1.5 to 2 Tablespoons is good)."
- "Garnish with fresh basil and serve with bread of choice."
- "Enjoy!"
