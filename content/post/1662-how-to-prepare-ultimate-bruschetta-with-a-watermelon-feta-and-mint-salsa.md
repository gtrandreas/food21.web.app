Call me unadventurous, but I had never even heard of a watermelon feta salad before versions of it started popping up on food blogs everywhere. Even then, the very thought of it gave me pause. Although Pepin cuts a small, seedless watermelon into rounds with a melon baller (adding the trimmings to the salad, too, so as not to waste them), you can also chop the watermelon. The salty, creaminess of quality feta combined with the sweet, crunchiness of a perfect summer watermelon along with fresh mint and the tang of the balsamic glaze is just so fabulous and refreshing.
