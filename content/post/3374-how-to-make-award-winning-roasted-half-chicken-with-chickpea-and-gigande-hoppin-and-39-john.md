As I was telling my friend on Faceboook the other day, I love roasted chicken. Hoppin&#39; John is also known to many as Carolina Peas and Rice. Gullah or Low Country cuisine reflects the cooking of the Carolinas, especially the Sea islands (a cluster of islands stretching along the coats of South Carolina and northern Georgia). Hoppin&#39; John is the textbook example of how hard it can be to recreate the traditional dishes of the antebellum Southern kitchen, and it&#39;s not just a matter of recipe or In classic Carolina pilaus, chicken or shrimp were often cooked in the pot along with the rice.
