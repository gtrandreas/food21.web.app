1. Prepare 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1. Get 3 cans tomato sauce
1. Prepare 1 medium onion (finely chopped)
1. Get 1/4 cup yellow bell pepper (finely chopped)
1. Prepare 3 large garlic cloves (finely minced)
1. Prepare 1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Make ready 2 zucchini (finely sliced)

Give this recipe a try and let me know. If you want to make a gluten-free vegan lasagna that&#39;s as creamy and cheesy as the original, zucchini and tofu can help. When salted, the excess moisture is drawn out, leaving you with a lasagna just as firm as the noodle version. Mashed tofu, when seasoned correctly, tastes eerily similar to ricotta, but.
