recipeingredient:
- "4 oz. bar of semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped"
- "1/2 cup vegetable oil"
- "3 large eggs at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1 3/4 cups all purpose flour"
- "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1 1/2 tsp. baking powder"
- "1 tsp. salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large, heatproof bowl, melt the chocolate in the microwave in 15 second increments, until completely smooth. Allow it to cool slightly."
- "Once slightly cooled, whisk in the oil, eggs and vanilla extract."
- "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and beat together until combined. I recommend using a stand mixer if you&#39;ve got one (this dough may have broken a whisk attachment on my hand mixer when I didn&#39;t feel like breaking out my stand mixer). The dough will be very thick and slightly greasy."
- "Cover the dough and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 4 days. If you chill for more than 3 hours, let the dough sit out at room temperature for 30 or so minutes before rolling it out."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a few large baking trays with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper."
- "Roll out balls of dough, about 1 1/2 tbsp of dough per ball. Place them about 3 inches apart on the prepared trays."
- "Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the tops begin to crack."
- "Remove them from the oven and let the cookies cool on the tray for 5 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
- "If drizzling the salted caramel over the top, wait to do it until the cookies are completely cooled. Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Caramel will set after a couple of hours."
