Mix 1 tbsp of cornstarch to 2 tbsp of water, mix well and add to crock pot or roasting pan, scraping the yummy bits on the bottom, bring to boil and simmer for 10 minutes,  for gravy. If its to thick slowly add alittle more broth to your desired consistency.  My hubs skips this step when I&#39;m working and just uses the yummy broth so I season the bird really REALLY WELL originally..    No matter how you cook it,  Let chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving."
- "Enjoy!!!!!!"
