I have a particular vegan coconut yogurt that I&#39;m a. Fill a greased muffin tin with the granola mixture and use a spoon to form the crust. Yogurt (you can make your own with an Instant Pot!) Frozen berries (frozen fruit will melt in the fridge, so it provides extra juiciness/liquid to the cups) or fresh fresh berries. Fill with your favorite yogurt and fresh fruits for a complete healthy meal! These little granola cups are super easy to make.
