- "1 lb fresh asparagus"
- "1 tbs extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 tsp lemon pepper seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and gently pat dry asparagus. Trim woody ends (this is generally about 2 inches above the flat end). Just hold the bunch together and chop straight through all the stalks at once."
- "Place asparagus in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with seasoning and toss to coat again (no need for salt unless your lemon pepper seasoning contains none)."
- "Spread seasoned asparagus out in an even layer on a baking sheet so the spears aren&#39;t touching each other (I lined mine with parchment)."
