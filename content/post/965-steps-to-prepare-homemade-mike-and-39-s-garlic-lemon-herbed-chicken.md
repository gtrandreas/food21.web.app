- "Remove the brown ends from garlic. Then, smash your garlic with a large Chefs knife and fine chop it. Also, zest the peel of one large lemon and squeeze out and reserve all of its fresh juices. You&#39;ll need at least 3 tablespoons of lemon juice so make her a big one! Slice the other lemon. Reserve 2 slices of lemon for a plate garnish, if desired."
- "Add olive oil and smashed chopped garlic to a heated pan. Simmer for 1 1/2 minutes but, be very careful not to burn garlic. In fact, stir it constantly. It&#39;s only a minute and a half."

- "Wrap up oven safe dish tightly with tinfoil and bake at 400° to 425° for 45 minutes or longer, depending upon your chicken breasts size. After baking, pierce your largest, thickest piece with a knife. If she runs pink - bake 5 to 10 minutes longer. Then, check her again."
