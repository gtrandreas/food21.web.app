recipeingredient:
- "1 cup bread flour"
- "3/4 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon saltI use 14 tsp"
- "1 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter"
- "2-3 tablespoons cold water"

- "1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips"
- "1 large egg yolk"
- "5 ounces dark chocolate chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make brown butter, just toss it in a sauce pan, and bring it to a boil. After a few minutes of boiling, the milk solids in the butter are going to toast and turn brown. Remove from the heat and pour into a liquid measuring cup to stop the cooking. Give it a stir and add 2-3 tablespoons of cold water to the butter to bring it back up to 1 cup of liquid. Set aside to cool to room temperature. This butter will give a rich, nutty flavor to the cookies."
- "Mix dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, salt and sift."
- "In a large bowl, add the sugars, vanilla, espresso powder, and cooled brown butter. Cream together with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and beat until incorporated. Add the dry ingredients, about ⅓ of the mixture at a time, and beat between additions until just incorporated. It’s okay for there to be a bit of unmixed flour on the edge of bowl, this will be incorporated in the next step."
- "Using a spatula to fold the chocolate chips and chunks into the dough"
- "Scoop the cookies onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. For optimal flavor, cover and refrigerate for 1h or better overnight like I did."
- "Bake in a preheated oven 180oC for 12-14 minutes."
- "Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack."
