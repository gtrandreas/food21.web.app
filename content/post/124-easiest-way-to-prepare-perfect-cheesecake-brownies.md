- "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and chocolate together until completely smooth. Then, remove it from the heat, pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl and set it aside to cool slightly for 10 or so minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray a 9x9&#34; square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray, then line with parchment paper, leaving an overhang to easily lift out the finished brownies. Set it aside."

- "Bake for 32-36 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs. If the toothpick is clean, that means the brownies have overcooked."
