- "1 large butternut squash made into noodle shapes with a spiriliser"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the onions and carrots thinly and arrange them in the bottom of your slow cooker. If the turkey leg doesn’t fit in your slow cooker, use a deep baking dish and you can cook it in the oven."
- "Season the vegetables with salt and black pepper, sprinkle all of the sage over the vegetables, then place the turkey leg on top. Season the turkey leg again with more salt and pepper."
- "Cook in the slow cooker for 9 hours on low. If cooking in the oven, cover the dish tightly with foil ensuring that no steam can escape and cook at 100°C for 9 hours."

- "Shred the turkey leg off the bone using a fork. Ensure you discard any bone, skin and cartilage. Put the shredded turkey, cooked onions and carrots in a large saucepan."
- "Top up the reserved turkey juice up with hot water (or chicken stock) to make 250 mls of liquid. Put this stock in a blender with the boiled white potato and blend to thicken the stock slightly. Pour this sauce back into the saucepan with the turkey and vegetables. Mix well."
- "Stir fry your butternut squash noodles for 3 or 4 minutes and then stir into the turkey and sauce. Serve and enjoy."
