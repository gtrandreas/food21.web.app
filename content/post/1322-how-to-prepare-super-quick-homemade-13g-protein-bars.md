Bars can be a convenient way to help get enough protein as a vegan, but after trying a few pretty gross vegan protein bars, I set out to find the best ones. I was hoping to find at least one that had a solid amount of protein, was low in sugar, tasted good, and didn&#39;t cost too much. Let&#39;s get this out of the way: The protein in these bars comes fromâ€¦crickets. According to Exo, crickets require a tiny fraction of the water that cows do to make the same amount of protein, making them a more sustainable source. Our protein bars are convenient, filling, and nutritious snacks that can be consumed pre or post-workout.
