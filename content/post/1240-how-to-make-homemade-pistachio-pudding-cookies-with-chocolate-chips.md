recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set it aside."

- "Roll out the dough into balls, about 1.5 tbsp of dough per ball. Arrange them about 3 or so inches apart on the prepared baking tray."
- "Bake for 11-13 minutes, until the edges have started to brown lightly. The centers should still look very soft."
- "Allow the cookies to cool on the baking tray for about 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies into a wire rack to cool completely."
- "Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week."
