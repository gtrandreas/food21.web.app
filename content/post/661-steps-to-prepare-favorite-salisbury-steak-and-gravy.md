Salisbury steak is a classic American dish, similar to Hamburg steak and not too different from meatloaf and meatballs (except in shape). Seasoned with onion, garlic, and plenty of black pepper, formed into a steak-like patty, and pan-fried, it&#39;s served with a rich and meaty mushroom brown gravy. Salisbury steak also freezes well, so feel free to double the recipe and freeze half. Salisbury steak isn&#39;t a steak, it&#39;s basically fancy version of a bun-less hamburger that is simmered in gravy and traditionally served with mashed potatoes. I hated it as a kid, but now I can&#39;t get enough of it.
