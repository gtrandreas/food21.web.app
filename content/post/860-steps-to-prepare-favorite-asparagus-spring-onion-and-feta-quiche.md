Spring vegetables shine in this easy, simple quiche. There&#39;s nothing more versatile than a quiche. Since spring veggies are abundant right now, we saut√© up asparagus and spring onion with thick-cut crispy bacon chunks. This mixed with a creamy, custardy quiche base goes into a soon-to-be flaky. Although I&#39;m calling this a crustless quiche because it doesn&#39;t have a pastry crust, it does have a crust of sorts.
