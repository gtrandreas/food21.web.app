recipeingredient:
- "1 cup rice I used a mix of brown rices but you may use regular arborio rice"
- "1 medium carrot"
- "1 medium red pepper"
- "1 cup butternut squash"
- "1 medium zuchini"
- "3 strips of prosciutto or bacon"
- "1 twig rosemary"
- "2 garlic cloves"
- "2 4 cups of stock or water"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- " salt and pepper"
- "1/3 cup dry white wine"
- "1/2 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in medium heat. Add the rosemary twig and the garlic cloves, as well as the prosciutto slices. I prefer to cook them until crispy. When done just remove everything. Use the prosciutto later for garnish. Discard the rosemary and garlic."
- "In the meantime prepare the veggies. Dice the pepper and grate the rest."
- "Once you have removed the prosciutto slices add the pepper and carrot. Saute for about 5 mins."
- "Then add the rice and stir it for a couple of minutes."
- "Next add the squash and zuchini. I prefer to add them after the rice as it will soak the water released by them."
- "Add freshly ground pepper. Then add the wine and let it evaporate. When you don&#39;t smell the alcohol any more add 2 cups of stock. Add the salt. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes."
- "Once most of the stock has been soaked check if the rice has cooked. Brown rice takes longer to cook and needs more stock/ water. If needed add more stock, until it has thickened. Then add the grated parmesan cheese and quickly stir with the rice, so it thickens more."
- "When cooked place desired amount on a plate. Garnish with the prosciutto and optional scallion and parsley. Enjoy!"
