- "Finely chop chicken and add to the mix, along with the paprika. Stir until sealed."
- "Add the chopped mushrooms, pepper, chopped tomatoes, mixed herbs, black pepper and beans to the pot and stir well. Leave to simmer on a low heat for 20 mins - you may want to add a little water to keep the mixture loose."
- "About 10 mins before the filling is ready, heat the oven (200 deg)and make your roux (I donâ€™t add cheese, you can if you prefer!) Itâ€™s super easy to make, mix the flour and oil - bring to the boil and immediately add the milk and a pinch of nutmeg, whisk as you go and be careful not to let it catch.

- "Now for the fun bit! Youâ€™ll need a big, deep dish for the lasagne. I layer my lasagne up like this: sauce, pasta, filling, repeat... then top the last pasta layer with a layer of sauce and cheese."
- "Pop in the oven for 30 minutes (handy to place a tray underneath to catch any dripping cheese..!) itâ€™s good to let it rest for 5 minutes or so before you serve! Enjoy ðŸ˜‰"
