recipeinstructions:
- "You may chose to add more or less beans depending on how thick you like the soup as well with the greens. I prefer this soup with lots of greens and reasonably thick. You can add potatoes to make the soup thicker aswell but I chose not too."

- "Add 1.5 litres of fresh water to a pressure cooker. Discard the old water and add the beans."
- "Cook for approximately 30 minutes."
- "If you don&#39;t have a pressure cooker you can cook them using a saucepan. Add 1.5 litres of fresh water to the saucepan and bring to the boil for at least 20 minutes. Lower heat and Simmer for another 30-40 minutes or until beans are almost mushy ensuring saucepan does not run dry."
- "Set the cooker aside until needed when the beans are done."

- "Place the greens in a bowl, 5-10 minutes before cooking add lukewarm water to the greens."
- "In another saucepan bring water to the boil. Add the cabbage to the water once it has started to boil. Press down with a spoon to submerge as much of the greens as possible. Boil for 5-6 minutes pressing down with the spoon often."

Great Northern beans, chopped yellow onion, white wine, garlic, and fresh thyme give this soup incredible flavor. For a weeknight supper, serve with slices of crusty bread spread with goat cheese.

Stir in the chopped parsley and remaining rosemary.
