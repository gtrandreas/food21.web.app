Hello everybody, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, punjabi style bhindi masala. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Punjabi style bhindi masala is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They're fine and they look wonderful. Punjabi style bhindi masala is something that I have loved my whole life.

When I order vegetarian fare in an Indian restaurant that is known for its North Indian fare, I usually look for an okra main course dish in the menu card. I heart bhindi and look for a new way to cook it away from the monotonous dry saute, sabji, stir fry, stew and stuffed bhindi style. This easy Punjabi style bhindi masala recipe has dry texture and requires shallow frying bhindi followed by mixing with spicy dry masala of onion and common curry spices.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook punjabi style bhindi masala using 7 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you cook that.

When you are cooking bhindi sabzi, don&#39;t add salt until the mid-way point of cooking your masala (when most components are partially cooked). Bhindi Masala is one recipe that I do often other than aloo bhindi bhujiya and it&#39;s goes so well with roti/paratha or poori is big plus point. Recently I started doing it Punjabi way of this with addition of few more extra spices and the result is just better. Clean the bhindi with a moist cloth.
