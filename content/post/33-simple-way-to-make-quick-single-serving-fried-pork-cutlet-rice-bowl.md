recipeingredient:
- "1 bowlful Plain cooked rice"
- "1 Tonkatsu or chicken katsu  homemade or storebought"
- "1/4 Onion"
- "2 Egg"
- "50 ml  Water"
- "1 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp  Mirin"
- "1 tbsp  Sake"
- "1 and 12 teaspoons  Sugar"
- "1 tsp  Dashi stock granules"
recipeinstructions:
- "If the tonkatsu is cold, slice up and heat in a toaster oven until the breading is crispy."
- "If you are heating up the cutlet, time it so that it will be hot when the sauce is ready. The rice bowl will taste better if everything that&#39;s in it is served piping-hot."
- "Slice the onion thinly (so it cooks through well)."
- "Beat the eggs. (Don&#39;t totally mix the yolk and white together! Just beat lightly as if you&#39;re cutting through the white!)"
- "In a small pan, heat the onion and the ingredients marked ◎."
- "Heat until it&#39;s bubbling, turn down the heat to medium-low (until it&#39;s bubbling slightly) and simmer for 2-3 minutes."
- "While the sauce is still simmering, portion out your steaming hot rice in a bowl."
- "Heat the cutlets in the pan and pour in about 2/3 of the egg mixture (don&#39;t pour it all in; leave about a third of the mixture for later)."
- "Turn up the heat slightly and cook while shaking the pan occasionally until the egg is about half set, then add the rest of the beaten egg mixture."
- "Continue cooking while shaking the pan until the egg you added last is just about soft set. Gently pour on top of the rice and it&#39;s done."
- "The soft creamy egg and the sweet-savory sauce mixes with the rice and it&#39;s so good! I use homemade chicken cutlets for this."
