recipeingredient:
- "1 Chicken breast"
- "1/4 Onion"
- "3 tbsp Sake"
- "3 tbsp Japanesestyle Worcestershire Sauce"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Mayonnaise"
- "1/2 Egg"
- "3 tbsp Plain flour"
- "1 Panko"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Discard the skin and fat from the chicken breast. Slice the chicken on the diagonal. Pound with a meat mallet and marinate with grated onion and sake for awhile (this will soften the meat)."
- "After about 30 minutes, add the sauce (I mix regular and thick Japanese worcester-style sauce) and mayonnaise and rub in. Let it marinate."
- "Beat the egg and mix in the flour. Mix well to create a thick egg liquid and then dredge the meat from Step 2."
- "Dip the chicken in panko and deep-fry slowly in medium-hot oil. At the end of cooking, increase the heat and fry until crisp."
- "Remove the chicken pieces vertically from the oil and prop them up to let the oil drain. This prevents the breading from getting soggy and keeps it crunchy."
- "Serve with sauce and fresh-squeezed lemon juice and enjoy. It&#39;s also delicious plain because of the marinade!"
