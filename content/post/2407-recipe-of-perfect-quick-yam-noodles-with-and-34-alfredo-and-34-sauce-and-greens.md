- " a little grated salty cheese"

recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the yam and cut thin noodle-like strings. If you can julian it - all the better, but you don&#39;t have to! This should take you about 15 minutes- I just do it in front of the tv."
- "Bake the noodles in a toster oven until a crispy with a tiny bit of oil - if you have virgin olive oil - awesome, if not - it&#39;s totally okay as well! The noodlrs are really thin, but there are a lot - so it might take a little while to cook. It took me about 10 minutes."
- "Once you&#39;re done cooking the yams and have them on a plate next to you,  fry the  mushrooms, onion and garlic in a bit of butter (note: if you want the dish to taste a bit more garlicy - add the garlic later on). Don&#39;t over cook them- you just want to brase the musrooms a little and coat them with the butter. It shouldn&#39;t take longer than 3 minutes."
- "Add the milk, cream and sliced cheese (I used gauda) to the pan - the sauce will reduce really quickly - but it&#39;s totally okay! The key is to do it as quick as you can. In the picture above you can see I wasn&#39;t as quick - so it was more of a creamy melted cheese than a sauce, but it&#39;s totally great as well. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper - this sauce is supposed to be a poorman&#39;s alfredo sauce so it&#39;s not supposed to be overly salty.  Pore the sauce on the noodles and mix a little."
- "Time for plating! Add some greens (I just use pre-made salad mix I get in the supermarket - no need to try very hard) above the noodles - as you&#39;re the one eating the dish you should decide how much is enough for you.  Add some grated salty cheese - I use Iraqi cheese, but feta will work fine as well."
- "That&#39;s it! You&#39;re done. You can add some walnuts, pecans, dried cranberries, pomogranate seeds, bacon bits works amazingly well with this, schnitzel strips (take chicken breasts/ a pirce of beef, smash it until it&#39;s about 3 sentimeters thin, cut it to strips, dip in an egg and then in panko/regular bread crumbs abd a little salt, fry until golden) and regular chicken breasts can work as well. I&#39;m supet lazy, so I just eat it with scrambled eggs. All in all it&#39;s a way to make your loved ones to eat more veggies - without them being veggies!"
