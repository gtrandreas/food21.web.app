recipeinstructions:
- "Make the sushi rice. Mix about 3 tablespoons of black rice and 1 tablespoon of sake with 180 ml of uncooked white rice. Add konbu seaweed to the rice cooker and set to cook."
- "Transfer the cooked rice into a large bowl and drizzle the sushi vinegar. Let rest for about 10 seconds to allow the rice to absorb the vinegar (use a sushi rice tub if available)."
- "Mix the rice well with a cutting motion and cool down with a fan at the same time. After it&#39;s cooled down, cover with a moistened tea towel on top to keep the rice moist and soft."

- "This sushi rice made with black rice looks beautiful, doesn&#39;t it?"
- "Squeeze the kabosu citrus and sprinkle with a little soy sauce. Have a bite!"
- "The sushi rice with black rice changes its colour immediately when mixed in with vinegar. The rice is packed with color as well as flavor."
