recipeingredient:
- " White cooked rice"
- " Vinegar"
- " Salt"
- " Sugar"
- " to 60 pieces Toppings neta of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the sushi vinegar ingredients and mix together well. Put into a pan and heat over low heat. When the sugar and salt have dissolved, it&#39;s done."
- "Use freshly cooked rice. If you use rice that&#39;s been kept warm for a while, it won&#39;t absorb the sushi vinegar and will become wet and soggy. Use a bit less water than usual when cooking the rice."
- "Transfer the freshly cooked rice to a pre-moistened wooden sushi tub, and pour on the sushi vinegar. Cut the vinegar into the rice with a rice paddle. Don&#39;t knead the rice."
- "Fan the rice to evaporate any excess moisture. This also adds shine to the rice grains,"
- "When the rice has cooled down to the point where you can touch it with your hands, cover it with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, then with the lid."
- "Each piece of nigiri sushi weighs about 16-18 g. With 3 rice cooker cups worth of rice (before cooking) you can make 55 to 60 pieces. When slicing the fish, slice against the grain."
- "If you hold the knife vertically 2 mm before you slice though the fish, the cut side will have a nice and clean finish."
- "This is how it looks when you hold the knife blade vertically. The right side of the slice will be a bit thicker."
- "Moisten your hands with vinegar-water (50/50 rice vinegar and water mixed together). Hold a piece of topping (a fish slice here) in your right hand, and spread on a tiny bit of wasabi with your left index finger."
- "Make a small round ball of sushi rice and place it on the topping. Make a dent in the sushi rice with your left thumb. This makes a packed sushi rice that is soft and gently falls apart in your mouth."
- "Press the top and bottom of the shari with your right thumb and index finger."
- "Press the shari with your right index finger to form the bottom of the sushi."
- "Roll the whole sushi in your palm and turn it over so that the topping is on top."
- "Press both sides with your right thumb and index finger."
- "Press the top of the sushi with your left thumb while you press down with your right index finger."
- "Flip it over."
- "Press the sides as in Step 14."
- "Press the top of the sushi with your left thumb while you press down on it with your right index finger, as in Step 15."
- "The nigiri sushi is complete, but if it feels too loose, repeat Steps 13 to 15 again."
- "Try making the sushi with all kinds of toppings - it&#39;s fun!"
