Pour the pesto over your vegetables and toss them to coat. If you went wild with the amount of veggies, and they look a little dry, feel free to add another glug of olive oil, white wine vinegar, and. I usually make my own pizza dough when I&#39;m making a pizza from scratch, but I noticed my local supermarket have a fresh ready rolled pizza dough in their chilled section beside the pastry and decided to give it a go. Now I&#39;m not saying I only ever make pizza from scratch, do any of us? But instead of just a basic pesto pasta I added in a few fresh vegetables, roasted them so they got nice and sweet, and tossed them in the pasta along with the pesto!
