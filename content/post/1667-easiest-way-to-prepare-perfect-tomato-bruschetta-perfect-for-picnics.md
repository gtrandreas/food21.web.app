- "Slice french baguette into slices about 1 centimetre across and very lightly spray with oil. Bake in the oven on a very low temperature until crunchy. I’m lucky and I’ve just bought a new oven which goes below 50c, but if yours doesn’t, turn the oven off as soon as the bread starts to colour and leave for about an hour. I baked mine on a very low heat for around 90 minutes. You could griddle as an alternative if you prefer."
- "When the bread is cool, rub with the garlic clove - it will create a paste. Chop the tomatoes and top the bruschetta. Sprinkle with sea salt, fresh basil and chopped chilli. I didn’t this time, but I sometimes add a squeeze of lime."
- "The bruschetta will keep for a couple of days in a tin. I’ve made loads so I’ll be adding some alternative plant- based toppings soon, feel free to follow me if you would like to see them."
